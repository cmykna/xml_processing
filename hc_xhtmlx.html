Others with truly great ideas (that could bring great wealth) never even try because they don&#8217;t believe they have the skills necessary for the project or because they fear failure more than they crave success. </p><p>Relax! We don&#8217;t want that to happen to you, so we&#8217;ve written this unique book specifically for young companies and for new product developers and inventors. We believe that you&#8217;ve been given that great idea for a reason&#8212;so you need to start moving on it. Picking up this book is one of your first major steps to realizing your dream. </p><p>The next step is reading it. </p></div></div><div class="Part"><h3><i>WHAT MAKES THIS BOOK DIFFERENT </i></h3><p>Most books on product development and launch are written by college professors or corporate types whose primary readership is the management teams of big corporations. Those companies will have hundreds of employees focused on each product&#8217;s R&amp;D (research and development), branding, marketing, and sales. Many will also have the luxury of spending hundreds of thousands&#8212;or even millions&#8212;of dollars to launch a single product. </p><p>That&#8217;s not our audience! </p><p>Though we, the writing team, have all been corporate types at </p><p>early points in our careers, we are three creative people with very di</p><p>verse backgrounds who are also from very different parts of the country (the East Coast, the Midwest, and the West Coast). Over the years, we&#8217;ve been store managers and buyers; national sales and marketing directors for viable, growing companies; trade show exhibitors (one of us later managed shows); columnists and editors for business magazines&#8212; and we&#8217;ve all been product developers, too. We&#8217;ve been in the trenches! We know where you&#8217;re at and what you likely need <i>right now </i>to succeed. </p><p>This book is written specifically for start-ups and other small companies with few employees (likely one to twenty-five) where the handful of people at the top must be involved in all stages of a product&#8217;s planning and debut. So often, these companies are made up of creative individuals who don&#8217;t have a clue about the other aspects of success: market research, packaging, media kits, trade shows, networking, and so on. Furthermore, at this stage of their companies&#8217; development, they can&#8217;t afford to hire top-notch people in the areas where they are lacking. Subsequently, often it comes down to &#8220;great idea . . . no follow-through . . . ultimate failure.&#8221; </p><p>Of course, occasionally someone brings a product to market that is so original that it becomes a &#8220;media darling.&#8221; We&#8217;ve watched this happen, then watched the same company falter when introducing subsequent products. They become yesterday&#8217;s news! They lucked out with their first item, but unfortunately never built the infrastructure needed to carry the company forward. They missed important steps and, as product developers, seldom have the other necessary skills to go back and fix their oversights and blunders. </p><p>If you read and follow the simple steps in this book, such a sad scenario won&#8217;t happen to you! <i>Launch It! </i>will help you and your staff become mini-experts in all phases of product development, marketing, and sales. You don&#8217;t have to read ten books to get started on a successful path, you can read just one. And while you won&#8217;t finish this book with enough knowledge about any of its topics to teach a class, you will have the right basic information to help you take all the proper steps along the way and avoid those common mistakes that we&#8217;ve watched hundreds of others make. We&#8217;ll also teach you where and how to save time and money. It&#8217;s like an accelerated class to accommodate your very busy lifestyles! </p><p>Best of all, for companies that are already up but struggling, this book&#8217;s step-by-step formula makes it easy to identify which steps you&#8217;ve missed. Go back and complete them and your chances of suc</p><p><i>xiv </i><i>xv </i></p><p>cess will increase dramatically. It&#8217;s a winning formula you can use time and again, whenever you&#8217;re creating something new. </p></div><div class="Part"><h3><i>THIS BOOK IS DIVIDED INTO FIVE EQUALLY IMPORTANT PARTS </i></h3><p>First up, you&#8217;ll find Building a Solid Foundation, which covers trends and your target customer groups (both retailers and consumers), and presents those all-important questions every entrepreneur or designer should ask <i>every time </i>they develop something new. This section will help you decide whether your current idea is a good one and then show you how to tweak it to make it much better. We&#8217;ll help you figure out how to position and package your new item, then show you how to build or restructure your business to make it a strong one. </p><p>Part Two, Successfully Launching Your New(est) Product, is where you&#8217;ll find out how to court the media to get your product the attention it deserves and learn about working with an outside sales team, if you choose to go that route. There are three important chapters on trade shows, teaching you which ones to pick for maximum exposure for your products, how to create a trade show booth that will grab buyers&#8217; attention, and what to do (and not do!) during the trade show to increase your success on-site. This section also includes two important chapters filled with additional marketing ideas (many outside the box) to increase your company&#8217;s sales success. We also offer helpful and interesting advice to use as you travel the country to showcase your product. </p><p>Part Three, Advice from Other Industry Experts, contains a single but important chapter, Advice from the Pros. We wanted to offer you advice beyond our own, so here you&#8217;ll hear from a variety of industry leaders who offer their expertise on trends and developing products, plus their keen observations on what they see companies doing right and wrong in the marketplace. Sage advice worth following! </p><p>Part Four, Outsourcing, Importing, and Exporting, also consists of a single chapter, A Crash Course in the Global Market. This chapter is filled with important information for U.S. manufacturers who want to consider making their products abroad, for U.S. companies that wish to import items from abroad, and for international companies that want to have a successful U.S. debut. </p><p>At the end of the book is a valuable Resource Guide that you can use time and again. </p><div class="section"><p>Throughout </p></div><p>the book we&#8217;ve inserted interesting sidebars,<br/></p><p>Launched &amp; Growing: Company Stories to Inspire You, that are short snippets about a wide assortment of company founders and their businesses. In several cases they&#8217;ve defied the odds to become successful, eventually growing their businesses into billion-dollar enterprises. It&#8217;s our hope that knowing where they&#8217;ve been and how far they&#8217;ve come may help increase your own confidence level as you move forward with your product. </p><p>Knowing the value of your time, we have tried to be precise and keep the chatter to a minimum. Twenty-plus topics are a lot to cover, but we&#8217;re confident this book will carry you through your product&#8217;s launch&#8212;and beyond. Eventually you may want to study some of these subjects in depth. If so, good for you! You can always bone up on individual topics later . . . perhaps when you&#8217;re lying on a beach somewhere toasting your initial success. </p><p>Wishing you the best! </p><p>&#8212;Molly, JoAnne, and Michael </p><p><i>DISCLAIMER: </i>Readers should know that this book&#8217;s trends, resources, and other materials are up-to-date at the time we are writing it. There is always the chance that some sources may relocate, merge with others, or go out of business, and that some other fine detail may change over time due to ongoing market changes. These should have little influence on the overall advice given. While our advice is based on years of experience, we encourage you to seek the opinions of others as well. All advice given is ours and not that of our publisher. </p><p><i>xvi </i></p><p><i>TESTING YOUR CONCEPT&#8217;S <br/>VIABILITY AND MOVING IT <br/></i></p><div class="section"><h4><i>FORWARD </i></h4><p>You have this idea for a new product, and you think it&#8217;s a good one. So, what do you do next? </p><p>Many people with great new ideas simply do nothing. They assume they don&#8217;t have the talent, time, or money to develop it anyway, so why pursue it? (You&#8217;ll soon discover that they&#8217;re wrong!) </p><p>For some of you who are already established in a design or manufacturing business, you&#8217;re lucky to have <i>another </i>excellent idea&#8212;and this time you want to take all the steps to assure it&#8217;s a success. Good for you! You&#8217;re about to save time and money and learn a whole new set of important skills you&#8217;ll wish you had back when you were just starting out. </p><p>For others, this may be your <i>first </i>potentially important idea. Perhaps it just came to you today, but more likely you&#8217;ve been tossing it around for awhile and finally you&#8217;re taking the most important step&#8212; the first one&#8212;to actually decide if it&#8217;s really worth pursing. Congratulations! The first step of acknowledging and owning the idea is one of the hardest steps. After all, once you put it down on paper, it becomes something concrete, something real that you can move forward. And who knows, it may change your income level, your sense of purpose, your happiness quotient&#8212;and your entire life! </p><p>So who gets these bright ideas, and why you and not someone else? </p><p>In her best-selling book <i>Simple Abundance, </i>author Sarah Ban Breathnach notes that many people believe that all of us are privy to many great ideas in our lifetime. &#8220;The bottom line is that the work must be brought forth. If you don&#8217;t do it, someone else will,&#8221; she writes, explaining that good ideas, if not pursued quickly, move on to </p><p>other people. We agree. After all, how many times have each of us no</p><p>ticed a great new product in the marketplace and realized we had that idea, too. We simply let the idea pass. Now someone else who acknowledged the idea and did the work was raking in the cash&#8212;and having all the fun. </p><p>But this time is different. This time it may be your turn to pursue greatness. And you&#8217;ve invited us along for the ride. Good for you! We can be your not-so-silent, but unpaid, partners as you move forward. And lucky you: we already know what you should do next, and what you should do after that, and after that. In fact, the steps presented in these chapters will make your pursuit much easier, especially if you follow our complete formula. (Yes, that&#8217;s the trick. You need to take each step if you plan to meet your product&#8217;s full potential.) </p><p>First, some good news for beginners: for those of you who aren&#8217;t in business yet but want to build a company around your concept, the great news is that nowadays you have so many options open to you. If you prefer, you&#8217;ll be able to outsource many of the business aspects that you simply don&#8217;t want to do on your own or just the ones that cost too much at first. You won&#8217;t need as much up-front money, either. (More on this later in several chapters, including chapter 11, Choosing Your Company&#8217;s Team: How to Make Everyone Happy, Including Yourself! You&#8217;ll also be able to read a success story in one of our Launched &amp; Growing sidebars about a man who built a superb internationally recognized company over eight years as a one-man operation.) </p><p>More good news for beginners: if you don&#8217;t want to start a company, you don&#8217;t have to. Once your idea is properly developed (read <i>at least </i>chapters 1 through 6), established companies may be willing to pay you a designer&#8217;s fee and ongoing royalties that can really add up. If your idea is great and your negotiating skills (or those of your attorney) sound, you may even get rich after putting only minimal work into your idea. </p></div></div><div class="Part"><h3><i>THE KEY TO SUCCESS: PRODUCT VIABILITY </i></h3><p>But first things first. Let&#8217;s get started by determining if your idea is truly something that is needed in the marketplace. Have you written your idea down on paper yet? Make it one short sentence. For those of you who are long-winded, keep it down to two. </p><p><i>4 </i><i>5 </i></p><p>Next, write another sentence stating why you think the world needs your product. We don&#8217;t want to look down at your notepad and see something as general as &#8220;Everyone needs it!&#8221; or &#8220;It will change the world!&#8221; Big statements such as these will only make your task seem daunting. </p><p>Instead, write something factual such as: &#8220;My product will help young women/new parents/high-end home owners/college students/ frequent flyers do <i>this </i>much better&#8221; or &#8220;My product should cut the time people take to do <i>that </i>unpopular chore in half&#8221; or &#8220;My product idea will make <i>this </i>item much more attractive so consumers can leave it out on the counter.&#8221; You get the idea, right? </p><p>Whether you&#8217;ve written something down or not, ask yourself these simple questions to determine if and why your product needs to be made: </p><p><i>Question 1: Is your product idea something </i><i>completely new, </i><i>unlike anything that exists and something that will likely appeal to a sizable segment of the American market? </i></p><p>We don&#8217;t mean all men or all women. That&#8217;s too general. No one is likely to produce a product with such broad appeal. Instead, we&#8217;re wondering if most people within a <i>niche market </i>(a clearly defined segment of the overall population) are likely to want it. The clearer and tighter you can make your statement, the better. And don&#8217;t worry now about your item&#8217;s potential crossover appeal to other groups. That&#8217;s gravy. We&#8217;re talking about your potential core customer base now. For instance, all preschoolers or every fisherman or most movie buffs may be your core consumers. If you don&#8217;t know if your core group is big enough, we&#8217;ll help you determine that in the next chapter. (By the way, did you notice which of those three groups was most promising&#8212; preschoolers, fishermen, or movie buffs? It&#8217;s the preschoolers, because their group totally changes every few years, followed by movie buffs, then fishermen, whose numbers are more static.) </p><p><i>Question 2: If you didn&#8217;t answer &#8220;yes&#8221; to the previous question, is your product idea </i><i>unique in its design </i><i>in a way that will </i><i>appeal to many more consumers</i><i>? </i></p><p>We&#8217;re not talking about simply slapping a new color or pattern on an </p><p>existing product, although that sometimes helps. For instance, when </p><p>Apple<sup>&#174; </sup></p><p>brought color to the computer world, consumers were wild<br/></p><p>with enthusiasm. But that was a bold move, representing a major shift in the way we thought about computers. Instead, here we are primarily asking if you&#8217;ve redesigned an unattractive or dated product to make it more appealing, easier to use, or more functional. </p><p><i>Question 3: If you haven&#8217;t answer &#8220;yes&#8221; yet, is your product idea one that will offer </i><i>noticeably superior quality </i><i>over all its competitors while </i><i>remaining in their price range</i><i>? </i></p><p>This is a tricky one unless you already understand the evolving marketplace. While it&#8217;s nice to have the top line, not all customers are willing to pay for superior quality. Surprisingly many studies note that wealthy Americans can be among the most conservative when purchasing products and services. In their book <i>Mass Affluence: 7 New Rules of Marketing to Today&#8217;s Consumer, </i>authors Paul Nunes and Brian Johnson have this to say about the new patterns in wealthy consumers&#8217; spending habits: &#8220;In many cases, offerings perceived as lavish or luxury goods are being rejected outright. Affluent spending is no longer synonymous with luxury spending.&#8221; So, while there is room for superior quality, if your product&#8217;s quality difference is perceived to be unnecessary, it may be more difficult to convince many consumers to switch from a familiar brand. However, if you can define your niche market, such as cigar smokers, women wanting anti-aging products, wine enthusiasts, or other groups inclined to try new things, superior quality might be a key to success, and some consumers may be willing to spend a little more for it. This is part of another countertrend called <i>trading up </i>in which people are willing to spend more, but only for products and services surrounding their passions. </p><p><i>Question 4: If you didn&#8217;t answer &#8220;yes&#8221; to the previous questions, is your product idea one that will </i><i>noticeably lower the price </i><i>of a popular item </i><i>without affecting its quality</i><i>? </i></p><p>Here we&#8217;re talking about a noticeable difference, hopefully to something that people buy frequently. If your idea is for a cosmetic or personal care item, a food or beverage staple, office supplies, greeting cards, or another item that people purchase many times annually, then you are on the right track if you answered &#8220;yes.&#8221; On the other hand, if you&#8217;re designing refrigerators, footballs, furniture, or another item </p><p><i>6 </i><i>7 </i></p><p>that lasts for years, your market share will be much smaller even with your lower price point. (In these cases, if you aren&#8217;t already established, you might want to go through the initial steps in this book and then sell your idea for a nice profit. You&#8217;ll still come out ahead.) </p><p><i>Question 5: If you didn&#8217;t answer &#8220;yes&#8221; to the previous questions, is your product idea one that will offer enough </i><i>new features </i><i>to separate it from the competition? And will these be viewed by the buying public as advantageous? </i></p><p>If we were to give you only one key word for market success right now, it would likely be the word <i>enhanced</i>. Enhanced products are showing up everywhere, especially in the food/beverage, cosmetic/personal care, electronic, and kitchen appliance markets, as you will discover later when you read one of our trend chapters. With thousands of new products being introduced monthly in the United States, making a product better by making it multifunctional is perfect market sense. </p><p><i>Question 6: If you didn&#8217;t answer &#8220;yes&#8221; to the previous questions, is your product idea one that you can </i><i>make and deliver quicker </i><i>than your competition, and </i><i>will this matter</i><i>? </i></p><p>This question generally applies primarily to products that are very popular and difficult for retailers to keep in stock (causing them to lose sales). If you can help them by filling a need, this will help you get sales. If your idea has created a major shortcut for producing a popular product, and you are sure others are not privy to your methods, this may work for you as long as your business (new or established) will have the infrastructure to follow through. </p><p><i>Question 7: Even if you&#8217;ve answered &#8220;yes&#8221; along the way, ask this crucial question: Does my product have </i><i>longevity, </i><i>or is it just a </i><i>flash in the pan</i><i>? </i></p><p>Many companies are built on longevity. But there&#8217;s nothing wrong with fads, either. Numerous markets, especially those for tweens, teens, and young adults, are filled with fads. These products are red hot for a season or two (longer if you&#8217;re lucky) and then must be retired quickly. If you have several great new ideas for these age groups, you might be </p><p>able to build a very successful business. Another good option is devel</p><p>oping and selling your idea to a company that already excels in this </p><p>field. They specialize in quickly getting products developed and into the stores before a concept is eclipsed by other novel ideas. They may even be willing to have your name listed as the designer, a helpful career move. </p><p>Our next question is for those already in business, but we hope all of you will read it. For beginners, note that an <i>SKU </i>is a &#8220;stock keeping unit,&#8221; which means a specific item within an inventory or a catalog. (When you see three different lamps on a catalog page, you are looking at three SKUs, even if they only vary in color.) </p><p><i>Question 8: Is this concept really new and positioned to make an </i><i>important contribution </i><i>to my company&#8217;s future growth, or am I just rehashing an existing SKU to get a bit more life out of it? </i></p><p>Sometimes adding a new color or pattern to your product line will temporarily help sales, but ultimately it can hurt your best sellers and dilute your business. While this may work part of the time, it eventually gets old&#8212;and gets many companies in trouble. Don&#8217;t put your product development on automatic pilot. Be daring! Pursue product ideas that will keep your inventory fresh in the eyes of retailers and shoppers. </p></div><div class="Part"><h3><i>IMPORTANT ADVICE FOR ALL OF YOU </i></h3><p>If you went through the list without a &#8220;yes&#8221; and you still believe the idea is a good one, you might need to alter it a bit to help it find a profitable spot in today&#8217;s marketplace. That&#8217;s okay, because as you move forward, you are going to adapt your product (we call this tweaking) to make it better <i>Entrepreneurs are simply those </i>or to reposition it for a bigger market <i><sub>who understand that there is </sub></i>share. Ideas often get better over time. However, for other readers, these </p><div class="section"><p><i>little difference between </i></p></div><p>questions may have set off some major </p><div class="section"><p><i>obstacle and opportunity and </i></p></div><p>alarms. Not all ideas are good ones, </p><div class="section"><div class="section"><h5><i>are able to turn both to their </i></h5></div><p>but don&#8217;t give up. Sit 	down with </p></div><div class="section"><div class="section"><h5><i>advantage. </i></h5></div><p>trusted colleagues or a mentor and </p><p><i>&#8212;</i><i> NICCOL&#210; MACHIAVELLI	</i>toss your idea around for awhile. There may simply be a component </p><div class="section"><p><i>8 </i><i>9 </i></p></div><p>that you&#8217;ve missed that can vastly improve your concept. Once you find it, you can get back on track. </p></div></div><div class="Part"><h3><i>HELPING YOU REALIZE YOUR DREAM </i></h3><p>You&#8217;ll find many good sources for business infrastructure information online. None is better than the U.S. Small Business Administration at sba.gov and (800) UASK.SBA. They also have over 1,100 Small Business Development Centers around the United States and in each U.S. territory offering individuals and small businesses one-stop assistance, including information on <i>grants and loans </i>that can help get your business up and rolling. Best of all, if you&#8217;re not a business expert, they can help guide your way so you don&#8217;t make costly mistakes. Their philosophy includes &#8220;inspiring creativity in our economy&#8221; and &#8220;empowering the spirit of entrepreneurship within every community to promote and realize the American dream.&#8221; Their help sources for everyone are extensive, and they also have special divisions dedicated to helping women, minorities, veterans, and Native Americans. </p><p>While it&#8217;s still too early to consider all your financial options (that comes later in the book, when you&#8217;ll be much better prepared to address them), it&#8217;s not too early to know that for some of you, <i>grants </i>may help you start your business or increase it later on. Grant money is sometimes a loan but most times money you can use at your discretion without repayment. It is given to new businesses or entrepreneurs based on criteria set by each grant organization. </p><p>Because various providers (governmental, commercial, or educational) often award grants once a year or once every six months, it will be important to start researching grants now, if you believe you will qualify. For additional information, go to www.grants.gov to learn about the process and to start finding reliable sources. Other grant locator organizations exist, some of which require payment for their information. If you choose to use one of these pay services, check it out first to make certain it&#8217;s legitimate and its information is up-todate. </p><p>Another excellent resource for you may be the National Association of Manufacturers at nam.org and (202) 637-3000. Their Web site provides important information for small business owners and for those thinking of starting a business. Dozens of other important assistance contacts are listed in this book&#8217;s Resource Guide. </p></div><div class="Part"><h3><i>PROTECTING YOUR IDEA </i></h3><p>Now that you know your idea is a solid one, you&#8217;ll need to start showing it to others. </p><p>This entails some precautions that you&#8217;ll want to put in place. They include a patent to protect your product idea, a letter of intent (a one- or two-page business letter signed by you and any partners, then formally filed with the government), and something called a nondisclosure (or confidentiality) agreement. This agreement must be signed by all other parties <i>prior </i>to showing or discussing your concept with them. This assures you that they will be held liable if they steal your idea or attempt to lay claim to part of your profits at a later date. The possible exceptions for confidentiality agreements are family and close friends. (You be the judge.) </p><p>To save time and money, there are many good resources for basic business agreements online, including StartUPbiz.com. They offer inexpensive, downloadable templates. You simply fill in your information or adjust the wording to suit your needs. </p><p>You can also visit an attorney for this purpose, which we especially recommend to those of you with technical ideas. We also recommend that you and your partners (if any) sit down with a certified public accountant near the start of your business. (All of this is covered in more detail in chapter 10, From Legal Forms to Order Forms: Handling All the Paperwork.) </p><p>For a patent, you&#8217;ll need to contact the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Many of their services are available at uspto.gov and through select public libraries (which are listed and linked to their site). On average, they issue a new patent every three minutes&#8212;not just to the average genius but to average Americans like you and me. </p><p>The USPTO offers two basic types of patents. This is how they describe each: &#8220;A <i>utility patent </i>may be granted to anyone who invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine, article of manufacture, compositions of matter, or any new useful improvement thereof. A <i>design patent </i>may be granted to anyone who invents a new, original, and ornamental design for an article of manufacture.&#8221; </p><p>Once you apply, the patent office will search to see if your idea is already patented. If not, you will be able to purchase patent rights (fees vary from $50 to just under $800 for basic filing, which can be done electronically or by mail. Additional fees may be applicable). After you </p><p><i>10<br/></i></p><p><i>11 </i></p><p>have applied, you will be assigned a number. Use it and the term &#8220;patent pending&#8221; as a safeguard during your initial stages of business. </p><p>For additional questions, the USPTO has 24-hour technical and general support lines at (800) 786-9199 and (703) 308-4357. They also have a special Web site and a toll-free line if you ever need to report piracy. In that case they can be reached at stopfakes.gov or at (866) 999-HALT. </p><p>While it doesn&#8217;t happen often, it&#8217;s sometimes difficult in today&#8217;s marketplace to completely protect your patented design over its prolonged term of usage, especially if your product will be made outside the United States. If your product becomes very popular, others may create knockoffs of your genuine article to try to capture part of your successful run. This is particularly true for foreign-made consumer electronics, high-profile luxury products, and popular clothing and footwear lines, along with medicine, auto parts, motorcycles, cigarettes, and memory chips. </p><p>Don&#8217;t let this potential problem scare you. Just realize it&#8217;s a fact of life that may hurt a business&#8217;s profit margins but seldom jeopardizes the company&#8217;s or the product&#8217;s popularity and health. In fact, the extra media attention may even increase your sales. </p><p>Of course, some companies want to sue if the counterfeiter can be located. These lawsuits can take years to wend their way through the courts and cost thousands with varying results. Mary Jane Craig of Western Exhibitors/Universal Shows, a trade show company, perhaps put it best when she said, &#8220;When you&#8217;re copied, consider it a compliment. To patent an idea [in most nontech industries] is usually a study in futility; a person only needs to change the design slightly to get past lawsuits. I see people spend money and time in court pursuing these cases and losing. Move on and put your energy into something new instead!&#8221; </p><p>We believe her advice is solid, especially if you start courting more of those good ideas that come your way. </p></div><div class="Part"><h3><i>CHECKING OUT THE TREND CAPITALS </i></h3><p>While today&#8217;s media outlets now bring current trends and fads to living rooms across America earlier than ever, there are still a few recognized places in the United States that establish most trends and fads. These </p><p>are the cities or regions where many of the leading-edge product de</p><p>velopers live or journey to when they&#8217;re ready to show off their new wares. They&#8217;re also where the world&#8217;s great flagship stores are located. If you, as a new product developer, plan to create a cutting-edge product, we highly recommend you visit one or two of these important cities or regions to check out the competition <i>before </i>you launch your line. </p><p>Most Americans are already aware that New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco have long been at the forefront of trends and fads. You&#8217;ll often see what&#8217;s truly new in those cities first. However, many other cities have pockets of cool merchandise, too. Of note are Chicago and Miami. </p><p>If you plan to visit, first read their city magazines and newspapers (online or by visiting a newsstand) to spot the current trend shops. You can also ask your hotel&#8217;s concierge to assist you. Many of these stores have Web sites that will show you a sampling of what they carry. However, you won&#8217;t be able to see all the fun and imaginative ways they&#8217;ve displayed their products unless you visit in person. </p><p>Each of these five trend centers is a shopper&#8217;s paradise&#8212;and, more importantly, a product creator&#8217;s graduate school. To stay on top, visit often. </p></div><div class="Part"><h3><i>CREATING A MISSION STATEMENT </i></h3><p>Where do you want to go from here? </p><p>As a final step for this chapter, consider writing an early-stage mission statement, which can be adjusted later, as you see fit. We&#8217;d like to have you write one now, if you feel comfortable doing so, because it will help give you a sense of purpose as you move forward. It needn&#8217;t be more than a sentence or two. It should dedicate your efforts to something loftier than your own financial success (which is important, too). State what you&#8217;d like to accomplish with your new product (and future ones). Here are some good examples: &#8220;My company will be dedicated to creating affordable, ecologically safe cleaning products for the home&#8221; or &#8220;I dedicate my efforts to creating products that will help educate students about tolerance in hopes of creating a better world.&#8221; Phrases like &#8220;superb quality at half the price&#8221; or &#8220;easy to use and virtually maintenance free&#8221; are also great, if they&#8217;re applicable. </p><p>Read your statement daily and change it as you go along to rede</p><p><i>12 </i><i>13 </i></p><p>fine your product and business as you build them. Eventually it will become a comfortable way to describe your business and remind you how far you&#8217;ve come since taking these first initial steps. </p><p>Hopefully, now that you&#8217;ve read the first chapter and completed these first steps, you have a sense of relief&#8212;and accomplishment. It&#8217;s okay to give yourself a pat on the back. You&#8217;ve started the success process. </p><p>One of the things we love about advising people with new product ideas is getting to see them have a lot of &#8220;Aha!&#8221; moments, during which they develop a sense of clarity and purpose. That makes moving forward with their project so much more fun. We find that most of our clients need a lot of hand-holding. So that&#8217;s what we&#8217;ll plan to do for you, too, over the next twenty-two chapters. We know that sounds like a lot of reading, but if your idea is really a good one, they&#8217;ll just fly by! </p><div class="section"><h4><i>CHAPTER 2<br/></i></h4><p><i>THE BEST WAYS TO </i></p><p><i>IDENTIFY AND FIND YOUR </i></p><div class="section"><h4><i>CUSTOMER BASES </i></h4><p>The American marketplace is huge (nearly 300 million people) and currently growing at a rate of 13% population growth every decade. Studying these patterns can be fun&#8212;and very revealing. Understanding at least some of the numbers will help you find important secondary markets, which could increase your sales dramatically. Because we don&#8217;t want the process to become daunting, we&#8217;ve simplified it for you. </p><p>While we can&#8217;t help you exactly define where your company&#8217;s products will best fit into the marketplace without seeing your merchandise firsthand, we can help you find your own specific answers. Luckily, you don&#8217;t need a big budget or much time to do this. But don&#8217;t skimp. Plan on spending two to five days researching on your own, or half that if you have a business partner or a friend who can help. Do this important exploration <i>at the start </i>of your project. Months from now, you&#8217;ll be glad you did. </p></div></div></div><div class="Part"><h3><i>THE TWO BEST TOOLS YOU&#8217;LL FIND </i></h3><p>The U.S. Census and the Consumer Expenditure Surveys will be your most important tools to identify your core and secondary customer bases. </p><div class="section"><h5><i>The U.S. Census </i></h5><p>As a resource, the U.S. Census is beyond compare! You can find it at census.gov.

While the basic info is free, the Census charges a small-to-medium fee for downloadable copies of various reports. If you are on a tight budget, here are two alternatives: </p><ul><li>Use your local public library (free). </li><li>Purchase a copy of the latest world almanac (there are several brands; we use <i>The World Almanac and Book of Facts, </i>which is widely available for under $12). </li></ul></div></div><div class="section"><div class="section"><h5><i>Just for Fun&#8212;a Peak at the Data </i></h5><p>Here are some recent Census numbers and other reliable data that can affect your business and can be used in your business plan: </p><ul><li>Our country is almost evenly divided between men and women (who are a slight majority and are by far the biggest consumers). </li><li>Slightly over one-third of us are &#8220;minorities.&#8221; (Knowing that, make certain you cater to all your customers.) </li><li>Our fastest-growing minority is the Hispanic/Latino community with 57.9% growth since 1990.

Rowland, an educator and publisher, founded her company with a very specific vision of what she wanted to accomplish. Twenty years later, by all accounts her success has been on a grand scale. </p><p>Rowland built the business around The American Girl Collection<sup>&#174;</sup>, a series of books, dolls, and other products designed for girls age 7 to 12. At the time this age group was an underserved niche market. &#8220;The American Girl Collection was designed to teach young girls about American history, and give them a sense of pride and self-awareness of traditions in growing up female in America,&#8221; Rowland notes, explaining her company&#8217;s mission statement. </p><p>One of Rowland&#8217;s early mentors was the late Rick Chollet, a neighbor, friend, and former president of Brookstone<sup>&#174;</sup>, Inc. Through his vision and her own, Rowland developed a multifaceted marketing plan that continues to serve the company today. For even though Rowland sold her company to Mattel<sup>&#174; </sup>in 1998, the Middleton office still controls the focus for American Girl<sup>&#174; </sup>products, even after Rowland retired and turned the presidency over to Ellen L. Brothers in 2000. (Brothers also serves as executive vice president of Mattel.) </p><p>For someone whose products are based on the past, Rowland&#8217;s marketing strategies have been contemporary and keenly focused. From the start, Rowland pinpointed several problems that prevented her from taking the traditional route into stores. She decided that she couldn&#8217;t compete for space with big companies like Hasbro<sup>&#174; </sup>and Mattel, yet didn&#8217;t have the financing to consider the discount store route. She rejected TV promotions that &#8220;make parents and their children victims of commercial hype,&#8221; and didn&#8217;t want to license her images for fear that if American Girl characters </p></div><div class="section"><p><i>17 </i></p><ul><ul><li>Emerging trend: the number of 18- to 24-year-olds living at home now surpasses 26.5 million (almost equal numbers of sons and daughters). The number of 25- to 34-year-olds living at home is </li><li>38.8 million (slightly more daughters). </li></ul><li>The poverty rate showed an increase to 12.5%. The numbers of children (17.6%) and seniors (10.2%) living in poverty continues to rise. </li></ul><p>started appearing on lunch boxes, sleeping bags, and other items without their unique stories, they could easily become a passing fad. </p><p>Instead, Rowland pinpointed three channels of distribution&#8212;consumers, retailers, and educators&#8212;then went about pursuing each in a different manner. For the books (six or more around each of the American Girl characters, whose lives span a period from 1774 through World War II), Rowland decided to sell through bookstores. For her high-quality dolls, direct-to-consumer sales were established through informative four-color catalogs. Rowland insisted that all dolls be sold with books, to ensure that girls would care more for the doll because they would become familiar with its background. Even so, 90% of the company&#8217;s books are sold through bookstores because the catalog encourages readers to support their local book dealers. Then to encourage doll sales, each book includes a postage-paid postcard for a free catalog (requiring a parent&#8217;s signature). Those postcards have become the company&#8217;s most important prospecting tool. Focused mailings to Junior League members also helped zero in on the company&#8217;s core demographics. </p><p>To engage the educational market, Rowland hooked up with Scholastic, one of the few companies readily allowed in the classroom, agreeing to pay that company a royalty on sales. </p><p>Later, Rowland added scope after realizing that direct mail companies have two important drawbacks: customers can&#8217;t touch products and manufacturers can&#8217;t readily meet and interact with customers. In the late 1990s the first American Girl Place<sup>&#174; </sup>(35,000 square feet) was opened in Chicago, followed by one in New York. The facility combines retail store with live theater, a fine restaurant (where girls are encouraged to bring their dolls), and other entertainment. In 2004 an American Girl movie was featured on network television, indicating that Rowland&#8217;s vision is going strong, well after her retirement. </p></div><div class="section"/><ul><li>America is &#8220;graying&#8221;: our median age is 35.3 (half the population older, half younger). While this sounds reasonably young, it represented a 2.4-year increase since 1990&#8212;the highest it has ever been. </li><li>Our fastest-growing market segment is 45- to 54-year-olds, with a 49% increase in this age group since 1990 (37.7 million total). (Meanwhile, the number of 18- to 34-year-olds actually decreased by 4%.) </li><li>There are 35 million senior citizens (over 65). In 2000 they accounted for one of every eight people (similar to the population of California). By 2025 seniors will account for one of every six people! </li></ul><p>That is just a sampling of what the U.S. Census can tell you. You can clearly see that it will help you define where to concentrate your efforts and show you customer bases to consider as you develop your current and future products. </p></div></div><div class="section"><h5><i>Consumer Expenditure Surveys </i></h5><p>These great aids are brought to you by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, at bls.gov and (202) 691-6900. At their Web site, go to their Inflation and Consumer Spending section to find detailed information on current buying patterns in many product categories. While the surveys may be a year or two old, they will give you the core information you need. Most are available in Adobe format. </p></div><div class="section"><h3><i>OTHER RELIABLE RESOURCES </i></h3><p>There are many other excellent information tools available to help you hone in on your primary and secondary customer bases. The more you know about your customers&#8217; needs and (more importantly) their wants, the better your products and marketing efforts will be. Here are a few other exceptional resources to help keep you on top. </p><div class="section"><h5><i>Consumer Magazines </i></h5><p>Consumer magazines help us spot fads and trends. We suggest you go to a major newsstand to decide which publications might benefit your </p><p><i>18<br/></i></p><div class="section"><p><i>19 </i></p><p>new, specific focus. A year&#8217;s subscription is always much cheaper than buying single issues. For your secondary markets, consider checking out some publications three to four times a year&#8212;or head to the library. </p><p>One additional note on consumer magazines. A few focus exclusively on that great American pasttime: shopping. They&#8217;re fun and revealing. The originator of this concept is <i>Lucky: The Magazine About Shopping</i>. If you haven&#8217;t read an issue, take a look the next time you&#8217;re at a newsstand (no matter what type of product you&#8217;re developing) or visit their Web site (luckmag.com). </p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="section"><h5><i>Trade Magazines </i></h5><p>These publications serve all types of industries. There is at least one (and often several) available on almost every conceivable product category. They often highlight emerging product trends worth watching <i>before </i>they hit the marketplace, based on information they get from manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers. Our Resource Guide lists some of the trade publications that you might find helpful. Since most libraries don&#8217;t carry a wide selection of trade magazines, you will likely want to subscribe. Many publishers will send you a complimentary issue so you can determine if you want a subscription. Additionally, you can check out trade publications at industry trade shows. </p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="section"><h5><i>Trade Shows </i></h5><p>You will also find three chapters about trade shows in this book. Trade shows are eye candy for product developers, featuring aisle after aisle of items produced by established and new companies in your field, or, in the case of gift shows, a solid cross section of many product arenas. Visiting trade shows at the start of your product development is crucial, allowing you to understand trends and your competition. </p><p>Trade show producers often allow people new to their marketplace access to their trade floors (usually for a visitors fee). Be prepared to show documentation of your project, a professional business card, and a business license to gain entry. Read each show&#8217;s policy and credential requirements ahead of time if possible to avoid being turned away. There are rules by which you must abide once you are on the exhibit floor. Here are the most common ones: </p></div><div class="section"/><ul><li>As a guest, you should dress up to make a good impression. </li><li>Don&#8217;t question or complain about guest fees or credentials required. These decisions are up to the show producer&#8212;period. If you are accompanied by someone else from your company, expect to pay a fee for each individual. It will be money well spent for market research. </li><li>Wear your visitors badge in a prominent place, clearly identifying your status. </li><li>As a visitor, you are allowed to walk the aisles for a general overview, but not to enter booths unless a gracious exhibitor invites you in. If that company will be your direct competition, tell them so and give them a chance to retract the invitation. Some will be willing to talk shop, others won&#8217;t. It&#8217;s their decision, not yours. </li><li>Never talk to an exhibitor if buyers or other trade guests are present. If you&#8217;re invited into a booth, step out so you don&#8217;t disrupt business. The event you are attending is the exhibitor&#8217;s opportunity to speak with clients, potential customers, and other members of the industry <i>first</i>. As a visitor, you should primarily be seen but not heard! </li><li>If samples are being offered (common at food and beverage shows and in some other markets), they are for buyers and other trade participants. Simply say, &#8220;No thank you, I&#8217;m not a buyer.&#8221; </li><li>Never bring a camera with you as no pictures are allowed. </li><li>Be professional and on your best behavior at all times. If exhibitors complain about you, it&#8217;s unlikely you&#8217;ll be invited to exhibit. </li></ul></div></div><div class="section"><h3><i>MORE HELPFUL RESOURCES </i></h3><p>Several companies specialize in supplying in-depth retail and consumer research data. <i>USA Data, </i>a source that can assist you with demographics, also offers mailing lists and address labels for sale. They are at usadata.com and (212) 679-1411. (More about them later.) </p><p>Retail Web sites usually offer excellent information and contacts for all the retailers you want to pursue. Study their sites carefully. </p><p><i>20 </i><i>21 </i></p><div class="section"><p>These tools and resources will give you a solid start. You can never know too much about the marketplace and consumers. You&#8217;ll be studying them as long as you&#8217;re in business&#8212;which hopefully will be until you decide to retire or sell your successful company to someone else. </p><p>In the following chapters you&#8217;ll gain even more insights as we study specific product trends. They&#8217;ll help you fine-tune your customer base and get on the fast track to success. </p></div><div class="section"><p><i>CHAPTER 3 </i></p><p><i>WHAT THEY ARE BUYING <br/>AND HOW TO GRAB YOUR <br/>MARKET SHARE<br/></i></p></div><p>In this chapter you&#8217;ll learn some surprising things about today&#8217;s consumers and have a chance to meet some of the specific ones you might encounter. Knowing your customer base is crucial. It can make the difference between getting a lukewarm reception to your new items and tweaking them to become major hits. </p></div><div class="section"><h3><i>GOOD NEWS FOR PRODUCT PRODUCERS </i></h3><p>Consider yourself lucky to be going into product production, because whether our economy is up or down, shopping for goods and services drives our country&#8217;s economic engine. According to an August 2002 report in <i>USA Today, </i>&#8220;Every year since 1929 until the present, with a few exceptions, consumer spending has accounted for between 60 and 70% of the total economy. Out of America&#8217;s 10-trillion-dollar economy, two-thirds, or 6.6 trillion, is consumer spending. About 40% of that, or three trillion, is spending on discretionary products and services.&#8221; </p><p>We suggest you read that last sentence again, aloud: a whopping 40% of American consumer spending is on things we want&#8212;not items that we need. Why? Because we have a lot more discretionary income than we did just fifteen years ago. Numerous reports note that the 1990s were very good years for many Americans. Investments paid off nicely, real estate went way up in many markets, and Internet millionaires and billionaires were being made left and right. As you&#8217;ll see later, education was another factor that helped pull people up. The </p><div class="section"><p><i>23 </i></p><p>1990s increased the nest egg and comfort level of many American families, and they&#8217;re ready to spend their money on much more than necessities. </p><p>Marketing expert Pam Danziger, author of <i>Why People Buy Things They Don&#8217;t Need, </i>explains in her book that consumers are looking for emotional satisfaction and want permission to spend money beyond the basics. Quality of life and emotions are what discretionary spending is all about, according to Danziger. Cater to shopper&#8217;s whims and you can come out a winner. She notes that there are several motivations (she calls them justifiers) that drive sales, including stress relief, beautifying self or home, hobbies, impulse items (including sale and bargain items), entertainment, education, and the all-important gift for oneself. &#8220;The perceived extravagance of a particular item usually determines how many justifiers are needed and to what extent,&#8221; Danziger explains. </p><p>Apparently, Americans are very good about using those justifiers. We are widely regarded as having the most affluent marketplace in the world. For decades, many of us have shopped &#8217;til we dropped, so to speak, and made purchasing products one of our favorite pastimes. That&#8217;s not about to change. </p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="section"><h3><i>THE WAY WE&#8217;RE SHOPPING TODAY </i></h3><p>While no one knows what&#8217;s ahead for our country, we have finally recovered from the post-9/11 economic downturn. Early 2005 reports brought the first truly good news on overall consumer spending. According to Visa USA, the credit and debit card corporation, 2004 holiday sales were up 19.6% over a wide range of retail categories. Holiday online shopping was an even bigger success, according to comScore Networks, a Web site monitoring firm, which reported that sales exceeded $15 billion for that period, up well over 20% from the same period in 2003. The start of 2005 also brought some promising news. According to a February <i>Washington Post </i>article by Nell Henderson, &#8220;The nation&#8217;s longest job slump since the Depression ended last month when U.S. employers hired enough new workers to boost total payrolls above what they were before the 2001 recession.&#8221; The American economy is a resilient one. </p><p>However, where we are shopping has changed in recent years. </p></div><p>Here is a look at the types of settings you might choose for your prod</p><p>ucts. Knowing what&#8217;s happening in each will help you adjust your products and your thinking to today&#8217;s marketplace. </p></div><div class="section"><h3><i>DEPARTMENT STORES STILL STRIVE <br/>TO FIND THEIR NICHE<br/></i></h3><p>For those of us who grew up over twenty-five years ago, department stores were a big part of our experience as children. They were the ultimate shopping havens, offering the latest brand-name styles, great service from salespeople who knew their product category (after years of working in the same department), superior dining, and a wide range of unique products. For those of us who grew up in suburbia, a trip to our downtown department store was often an all-day event. Department stores were a real destination, and families arrived home from a visit laden with boxes and bags of great merchandise. </p><p>Then during the early 1970s, department stores took several wrong turns&#8212;and they&#8217;ve been playing catch-up ever since. They tried to match the no-frills service of their emerging mass-market competition while keeping their prices steady, which infuriated their loyal customers. Their buying departments eventually became fully computerized, and the new (and often only) focus became profit margins, which didn&#8217;t allow buyers to take chances on new lines. Then the mergers came, and corporations such as Federated Department Stores, Inc. and the May Department Stores Company swallowed regional chains, creating streamlined buying companies in their place. While on many levels the mergers made sense and mimicked what was happening to other types of businesses, suddenly all these great stores started looking like they&#8217;d been stamped out with the same cookie cutter. The final blow was the closing of so many flagship downtown stores across the country in favor of smaller suburban mall locations. Smaller stores meant fewer departments, including some that were crucial to keeping customers from roaming to adjoining stores. Suddenly the destinations were <i>gone </i>and their core customer bases left, too. </p><p>Today&#8217;s department store shopping experience in no way resembles our childhood&#8217;s. The big brands are still there&#8212;but they&#8217;re everywhere else, too. Great service disappeared long ago. Yet there&#8217;s hope: in recent years entertainment and events have become one of the few distinctions setting department stores apart from their competition. </p><p><i>24 </i><i>25 </i></p><div class="section"><p>Well-known chefs often do cooking demonstrations and sign their latest books, experts in various fields give lectures, and fashion shows are regularly scheduled. (If your new product needs to be demonstrated, that&#8217;s a plus when approaching department stores.) Some stores, such as Marshall Fields in downtown Chicago, are distinguishing themselves by featuring departments of unusual products by emerging international designers that are not readily available in the United States. </p><p>We believe that showcasing products first and taking chances are the only things that will help department stores emerge from their long-term slumber and reclaim their position as important players on the American shopping landscape. Yet whether this happens is up to the big parent companies. More mergers are likely. Early 2005 brought talk of Federated acquiring May Company to create a company of over 1,000 stores and nearly $30 billion in annual revenue. Individualism at the regional store level may be years away. </p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="section"><h3><i>SHOPPING CENTERS BECOME FRIENDLIER </i></h3><p>For years, American companies built shopping centers at a dizzying pace. Yet too many of these centers added to up one thing: oversaturation! Consequently, in 2003 only four major new shopping centers were added across the country. Meanwhile, sales have been stagnant or even dropped at many centers during the past few years. A big part of the problem: shoppers are so used to seeing &#8220;sale&#8221; signs in store windows that they now see those as &#8220;regular prices.&#8221; The other part of the problem: the average shopper spends only seventy-eight minutes at a shopping center&#8212;and 44% leave without making a purchase (many because they are simply overwhelmed by the size of the centers and the choices). According to the International Council for Shopping Centers, shoppers spend an average of $1 more for every extra minute they spend in centers; so the goal now is to keep them there longer. </p><p>Luckily, shopping center management companies are coming up with some creative ways to make people stay. The biggest change: many are adding customer services, such as concierges. According to a November 2003 report by the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>&#8217;s Dean Starkman, these new helpers are suddenly popping up everywhere in malls. Depending on the parent company, their services vary. They often serve as greeters, advisers, and even bag carriers; at some malls they even </p></div><div class="section"><p>provide free bottled water, headache remedies, diapers, baby wipes, </p></div><p>and M&amp;Ms. In other words, they&#8217;re equipped to become every shop</p><p>per&#8217;s best friend! </p><p>Additionally, relaxation pods for teens are popping up. In the United States teenagers and shopping malls have become almost synonymous in recent decades. Now, at some of the bigger ones, an effort is being made to give teens a focus beyond shopping so they don&#8217;t simply congregate in the corridors. Major soft-drink companies and other big corporations have sponsored retro-cool settings, with furnishings from the 1960s and 1970s, where teens can drop in for lite entertainment and snacks while out shopping. The pods feature an assortment of activities, including the latest music, computer stations, and MTV video screens. Seating areas are divided into small groups to help keep noise low. The overriding rules for use are simple: no drugs, no alcohol, and no violence. </p><p>Why would shopping centers create these special spaces for one segment of the market? Because numerous studies show that, as spenders, <i>teens rule</i>! They have a lot of discretionary money&#8212;from allowances, gifts, part-time jobs, and handouts from their parents&#8212; amounting to about $200 per month to spend on nonessentials. </p><p>Whether these pods take off in a big way&#8212;and what their long-term benefits might be for shopping centers&#8212;is still being determined; but our guess is that they&#8217;ll win approval and eventually be installed in many malls across the country. </p><p>It&#8217;s not just the customer service that&#8217;s improving. Shopping center developers are starting to change their opinions about the way centers should look. Rick Caruso of Caruso Affiliated is a Southern California developer of that new mind-set who has built numerous &#8220;lifestyle centers,&#8221; including Hollywood&#8217;s hot new shopping mecca The Grove. That center is typical of what Caruso&#8217;s firm builds: beautiful open-air, European-style town squares, complete with parks, fountains, entertainment, quality stores, upscale restaurants, office space, and often housing. Building townhouses or apartments within or next to a center creates more foot traffic and impulse sales. It also builds a sense of community that stand-alone shopping centers often lack. And where many traditional shopping centers can be recognized from a distance due to their tell-tale ring of parking spaces, lifestyle centers tend to feature enclosed or subterranean parking garages. Many also offer valet parking service. Expect to see more lifestyle centers in the future, but you&#8217;ll have to look closely because they do a great job of blending into their new neighborhoods. </p><p><i>26 </i><i>27 </i></p><div class="section"/></div><div class="section"><div class="section"><h3><i>BIG BOX BECOMES A WAY OF LIFE </i></h3><p>Wal-Mart and other mega-retailers dot the American countryside and have made their way into many of our major cities. These stores started becoming big players in American life back in the 1980s. They have reshaped American concepts about price and value, which has consistently kept smaller competitors on their toes. </p><p>Their numbers are staggering. Wal-Mart alone generates over $256 billion in sales annually (here and abroad) in over 3,700 U.S. Wal-Mart and Sam&#8217;s Club outlets that are serviced by over 1.2 million employees. (Their international division, started in Mexico in 1991, now boasts an additional 1,600 stores and another 300,000 employees.) </p><p>The numbers for other popular big boxes are much smaller but still impressive: $48 billion for Target Corporation and $47 billion for Costco Wholesale Corporation. </p><p>Likely the most original of the group is Costco, the Washington-based chain of membership warehouses that carries a quirky mix of products, from cake mix and salsa to hand-blown glass to computers and caskets. And just because Costco prices are low doesn&#8217;t mean their goods are cheap. Along with major brands in various categories, art is becoming a staple there. According to the Associated Press (AP), in early 2005 Costco offered their first Picasso&#8212;and it sold within days. The crayon-on-paper drawing, priced at $39,999.99, was purchased without fanfare by a Costco member who remains anonymous. According to the AP&#8217;s Donna Gordon Blankinship, &#8220;Art dealer Jim Tutwiler, who sold the Picasso, has been selling art through Costco for the past decade. He said Costco&#8217;s markup is one-tenth that of traditional galleries.&#8221; Creating yet another reason consumers love these no-frills warehouse stores. </p><p>For a long time, independent retailers worried about losing sales to the big box companies. Now, according to several reports, many small stores in close proximity to these giants are surviving, and even thriving, due to increased traffic. </p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="section"><h3><i>INDEPENDENT RETAILING TODAY </i></h3><p>Independent retailing is a tough business. We used to have a formula for evaluating independent retailers that went something like this: only one </p></div><div class="section"><p>out of ten stores is exceptional; the other nine are either ho-hum or </p></div><p>totally unworthy of being in business. Between big box stores and </p><p>assorted specialized chains that made big strides in the 1980s and 1990s, many of the mediocre stores were forced out of business. In some cases entire categories of independent retailers were almost decimated. </p><p>But the good news is this: today&#8217;s independent retailers are a new breed. They are more daring, carrying broader product categories than before, often creating a sense of excitement the minute you walk in the door. Their stores are sensory emporiums, creating a mood with great products and superb displays, as well as the right music, lighting, and even scents. These stores are usually staffed by knowledgeable, helpful people who really care about their customers. Of course, not every independent store is perfect, but most know that they must reach for excellence if they want to stay in business. </p><p>Why the sudden changes? Many changes have been brought about by teams of younger retailers who bring business or merchandising degrees to their operations. Whereas in the past, almost anyone could open a retail store, nowadays retailers are much more sophisticated. Today&#8217;s independent retailers read up on the latest trends, attend seminars at trade events, and check out the competition both here and abroad. The smartest ones don&#8217;t wait for customers to come to them. Through their Web sites, they are building direct-to-consumer tools and communicating with their customers regularly. They use special mailings and other marketing methods to court both individuals and corporate sales. And they get involved in their communities, building valuable relationships. </p><p>Our writing team marvels at the care, quality, and innovation used by independent retailers in their product selection and displays, not only in our own neighborhoods of New York, Chicago, and Hollywood but in strip malls and small towns around the country. More independent stores are getting things right nowadays. As a result, we have officially retired our old formula. While independent retailing is still a difficult business, its future looks bright. </p></div><div class="section"><h3><i>BET YOU A DOLLAR YOU CAN&#8217;T GUESS TODAY&#8217;S<br/>FASTEST-GROWING CATEGORY<br/></i></h3><p>For all Jay Leno&#8217;s <i>Tonight Show </i>jokes about their products, dollar-store chain owners are the ones laughing&#8212;all the way to the bank! In fact, a May 2004 <i>Business Week </i>article by Robert Berner and Brian Grow </p><p><i>28 </i><i>29 </i></p><div class="section"><p>crowned dollar stores the fastest-growing retailer segment in America, and there&#8217;s little sign of their growth abating anytime soon. </p><p>This category has become such a hit with shoppers that Target has now decided they want in on the action. In early 2004 Target announced that they would add dollar departments to over a hundred of their stores. If all goes well, they&#8217;ll incorporate dollar sections into their ongoing development plans. </p><p>The allure of dollar stores, which carry only merchandise priced at a dollar or variables thereof, now reaches beyond the traditional bargain consumer. While the <i>Business Week </i>article cites the stores&#8217; appeal to &#8220;the growing legion of shoppers who find Wal-Mart a bit too pricey or a bit too hard to get to,&#8221; there are many other shoppers who are equally appreciative. Studies have shown that teens love dollar stores because they help stretch discretionary income and carry a lot of &#8220;cool stuff.&#8221; Bargain hunters of all income ranges also seem to be drawn to these markets. One Los Angeles &#8220;dollar&#8221; store is referred to as the &#8220;Beverly Hills&#8221; 99&#162; Only Store, because it borders that city and its parking lot is filled with Mercedes. Obviously, the concept appeals to a wide spectrum of shoppers! </p><p>In addition to the popular 99&#162; Only Stores, which are touted to be the cr&#232;me de la cr&#232;me of that market sector, other dollar chains thrive. Over 4,000 new dollar stores were added to the American landscape during the past three years, accounting for a 34% increase. Already the stores carry many brand names, though stock levels change, and a product can disappear for a few weeks or even a few months before it returns. Consequently, savvy shoppers know that they need to stop into dollar stores often to make sure they get the best deals on their preferred brands. Look for this market segment to continue to grow&#8212; and for the product selections to improve as more vendors look for ways to work with these important retail outlets. </p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="section"><h3><i>INTERNET SHOPPING MAKES REAL STRIDES </i></h3><p>Remember when the dot-com bubble burst way back in 2000? Well, a lot has changed since then! Today Americans are back shopping online in droves&#8212;which is great for new product vendors. </p><p>According to Datamoniter.com, a leading market analysis firm, online purchasing now appeals to a broad spectrum of the American pop</p></div><div class="section"><p>ulation. Not surprisingly, baby boomers lead the way, purchasing 46% of </p></div><p>what is bought on the Internet. The second largest population segment </p><p>shopping online is 18- to 24-year-olds. Meanwhile, senior citizens are finding it&#8217;s a convenient way to shop without the hassle of leaving home. </p><p>Amazon.com, which was incorporated as a bookseller in 1994 and now carries a wide variety of products including toys, electronics, and apparel, had the type of holiday season in 2004 other retailers can only covet. According to their press office, the company &#8220;set a single-day record with more than 2.8 million units ordered, or 32 items per second, worldwide.&#8221; But for many the biggest surprise was their announcement that, while book sales thrived during the 2004 Thanksgiving weekend, for the first time consumer electronics was the company&#8217;s top-selling category. </p><p>Apparel sales are growing online, too, despite initial worries that consumers would view the inability to try things on as a major obstacle. Instead, online clothing sales are growing in double digits annually. According to a July 2004 report in <i>Apparel </i>magazine, &#8220;Online sales still represent a tiny piece of the overall retail pie. Estimates put online retail sales at almost 2% to 5% of overall retail revenue, and some project online sales will top out at about 10% of overall sales. But even so, online apparel e-tailing alone is now a multibillion-dollar business.&#8221; </p><p>The convenience of being able to shop 24/7 helped push sales up during the 2002 holiday season when approximately one-half of all U.S. shoppers made at least one of their purchases on the Internet. A year later, Sears reported its first $1 million Internet sales day during that season. </p><p>With continued advances in Internet technology, and the declining costs of running a Web site, it&#8217;s now predicted that online sales will soon represent 10 to 12% of all sales in such categories as apparel, accessories, and toys. </p><p>Even sales in the high-touch categories such as fine apparel, beauty products, and luxury items are expected to continue to experience online sales growth. Some of these sales will ultimately be helped by new technology that will make it easier to see exact colors and eventually even transmit scents. Online food and beauty products sales are expected to soar: imagine ordering a new type of gourmet coffee beans after first downloading its aroma to confirm your interest! </p><p>Our own Internet expert JoAnne Stone-Geier notes, &#8220;This generation and future ones more habituated to digital conveniences will not differentiate shopping experiences; shopping on the Net will just be shopping to them.&#8221; This means that the best times for Internet merchants are still to come. </p><p><i>30 </i><i>31 </i></p><div class="section"/></div><div class="section"><div class="section"><h3><i>TO DIAL OR NOT TO DIAL... </i></h3><p><i>M-commerce anyone? </i>The jury is still out on this one. Initially the concept of people buying things over their cell phones (mobile commerce) was touted as the wave of the future. Now, however, most players are rethinking the basic strategy, especially in the United States where the easy accessibility of larger computer screens makes m-commerce less attractive for all but small or immediate sales, such as movie or event tickets and carryout food. Elsewhere, m-commerce is growing faster but is still in its infancy. </p><p>According to a report by AT Kearney, a management consultancy, 1 to 3% of cell phone users globally use their phones to purchase goods. In Japan 12% use their phones for purchasing. According to the same report, North American users fall into the 3% category (for product and service purchases), with more preferring to use their phones for e-mailing (27%), gaming (7%), and banking (6%). Still, product and service sales worldwide are projected to be $88 billion in 2009. </p><p>With wireless network hot spots (Wi-Fis) popping up in restaurants, airports, and coffee shops, many busy people are utilizing these spaces to make even more e-commerce and m-commerce purchases while on the run. The future of shopping is almost here! </p></div><div class="section"><h3><i>DREAMING OF THAT FIRST BIG SALE<br/>(IT&#8217;S ALL ABOUT FINDING THE RIGHT NICHE)<br/></i></h3><p>You&#8217;re probably already thinking about the various places where you&#8217;d love to sell your product. Write a few of them down as your next step. </p><p>Which ones did you pick? Selling to top chains, great independent stores, and other important accounts isn&#8217;t out of your reach, even as a new product producer. Your dreams can be as big as your ambitions if you&#8217;re just willing to do the work. </p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="section"><h3><i>DOUBLE YOUR PLEASURE </i></h3><p>Many of you will have the ability to sell your products two ways. Sell your regular line to the majority of your accounts, and offer to cus</p></div><div class="section"><p>tomize your products and create exclusive offerings for major retail </p></div><p>chains. Double your vision and your efforts in this way and watch your </p><p>small business grow into a big one quickly; just make sure your business is running smoothly before approaching the big guys. When you&#8217;re ready, the Private Label Manufacturers Association may be of assistance. (More about them later.) </p><p>One of the tricks to working well with today&#8217;s retail chains is to understand their individualized needs. Many of today&#8217;s top retail companies are courting very specific niche markets within their various brand names, and they&#8217;ll want products that do the same. </p><p>To better understand their businesses, research their Web sites <i>thoroughly </i>before you put together your presentations. These companies usually post their business histories, their mission statements, a profile of their customer base, and even the causes they support. Look at their product assortment, the categories they carry, and especially at their sale items to determine what didn&#8217;t sell out quickly. Then, when you send your presentation or meet with them in person, let them know that you have a clear understanding and can cater to their core business with private label or exclusive products. Do your homework and you&#8217;ll look smart and capable of doing business at their higher level. </p><p>Here are some interesting looks at some of the top American retail companies and how they&#8217;re structured to narrowly define their customer bases. </p><div class="section"><h5><i>Age-Specific Focus </i></h5><p>The Wet Seal, Inc., established in Southern California in 1962, has gained success by understanding their market of young women customers and creating two brands for similar but distinctive bases. Their original chain is Wet Seal (462 stores) for young women in their teens and early 20s looking for trendy styles. To keep their core customers as they age, the parent company created a second brand called Arden B (96 stores) that offers more provocative clothing for women in their 20s and 30s. Despite their success, they missed when they purchased Zutopia, a small chain they planned to develop for the tween market. A short while later they closed that division. </p><p>Others are also defining their customer bases by age. Northern California&#8211;based Gymboree (the very company that got out of the tween market by selling Zutopia to Wet Seal) has had incredible success catering primarily to children. Their core retail brand is Gym</p><p><i>32 </i><i>33 </i></p><div class="section"><p>boree (580 stores) for newborns through age 8. Seeing another need, they further defined their business by establishing Janie and Jack (55 stores in a quickly growing division) for preemies through size 4T. Recently, they&#8217;ve also started rolling out Janeville (14 stores) for women in their mid-30s and beyond (well-to-do-moms). </p><p>In addition to age demographics, Gymboree defines their customer bases as those looking for &#8220;unique detailing and exceptional quality.&#8221; That&#8217;s also a helpful way to let busy shoppers know if Gymboree stores are the right fit for their pocketbooks and tastes. </p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="section"><h5><i>Income Focus </i></h5><p>Smart retailers and manufacturers often define their consumers by disposable income level as well as by age. By narrowing their focus, they help the massive U.S. customer bases clearly identify which product to grab off the shelf (in a manufacturer&#8217;s case) or which stores might be the best starting place when shopping. </p><p>An excellent example is San Francisco&#8211;based GAP, Inc., with over 4,100 stores worldwide. They&#8217;ve broken their customer bases into the reliable concept of good-better-best with their successful brands: Old Navy, GAP, and Banana Republic. </p><p>Manufacturers also use the good-better-best formula to blanket the market with their products. At one time, the Campbell Soup Company sold condensed soups only. Today they offer distinct lines, including Campbell&#8217;s<sup>&#174; </sup>Condensed (good), Campbell&#8217;s<sup>&#174; </sup>Chunky<sup>&#8482; </sup>(better), and Campbell&#8217;s<sup>&#174; </sup>Select<sup>&#8482; </sup>(best). But they didn&#8217;t stop there. The company also makes Campbell&#8217;s<sup>&#174; </sup>Kids Soups plus Campbell&#8217;s<sup>&#174; </sup>Healthy Request<sup>&#174; </sup>and Carb Request for health-conscious adults. They understand that almost everyone loves soup and that their customers fall into clearly defined niche markets. </p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="section"><h5><i>Style Focus </i></h5><p>San Francisco&#8211;based Williams-Sonoma does this particularly well. Here&#8217;s a look at their furniture divisions only: West Elm (4 stores, just rolling out) is for those who like contemporary and retro styles from the mid&#8211;20th century forward. Pottery Barn, a sluggish brand Williams-Sonoma bought and totally revamped, is now three distinct, popular brands: Pottery Barn (160 stores) offers classical styling in the </p></div><div class="section"><p>mid-price range, Pottery Barn Kids (over 40 stores and growing </p></div><p>quickly) has fun, colorful furnishings and decor for children, and PB </p><p>Teen (a catalog and a Web site) offers bright, fun styles for tweens and teens. The company also owns Hold Everything (10 stores) for storage options and is rolling out a luxury brand called Williams-Sonoma Home. </p></div><div class="section"><h5><i>Leisure-Specific Focus </i></h5><p>Even runaway successes like Seattle-based Starbucks Coffee<sup>&#174; </sup>are niche marketing. With over 7,500 stores, they&#8217;ve pretty much maxed out their site options in the United States, so they&#8217;re redefining their locations. In their Starbucks brand stores options include wireless hot-spot stores, airport stores, lunch stores, &#8220;urban coffee opportunities,&#8221; and stores with drive-through windows. They also hope to capture more nighttime business by offering Chantico<sup>&#174;</sup>, a new chocolate drinkable dessert, described as &#8220;best enjoyed as the perfect ending to a dinner out&#8212;so now you can end your day where it began.&#8221; </p><p>Additionally, they are rolling out a new brand called Hear Music (2 California test stores) primarily for teens and up, who are tech-savvy, music-loving coffee and tea drinkers. Starbucks decided to create this new brand after discovering that many young customers defined their original brand as &#8220;too corporate.&#8221; Hear Music allows customers to listen to over 10,000 CDs and then burn their own while they sip their favorite brew. </p><p>These few examples should help you understand how tightly businesses of all types are defining themselves. To interact with them and get their respect, you will need to do the same with your products. </p><p><i>34<br/></i></p><div class="section"><p><i>CHAPTER 4<br/></i></p><p><i>WHICH ONES SHOULD INFLU<br/>ENCE YOUR NEW PRODUCT&#8217;S<br/>DESIGN AND MARKETING?<br/></i></p><p>If you were to ask a hundred market experts to list the top ten product and market trends, the lists would look very different&#8212;and likely there wouldn&#8217;t be any wrong answers, except for a few &#8220;experts&#8221; who still get the words <i>trend </i>and <i>fad </i>mixed up. </p><p>We understand the confusion. After all, magazines at the supermarket checkout have headlines that proclaim: &#8220;We&#8217;ve got the twenty top trends for summer!&#8221; </p><p>Fat chance. </p><p>A look inside usually reveals the error. The magazine has a list of items that are passing fads. Here today, gone tomorrow: colors and patterns the fashion-conscious may enjoy wearing this season but wouldn&#8217;t be caught dead in next summer. </p><p>It&#8217;s not that fads are a bad thing. Far from it. In some markets (such as tweens, teens, and even the young adult market), fads help propel product sales for short periods of time. This, in turn, helps fuel the economy, which helps all product makers. </p><p>That&#8217;s why those age groups are so important to advertisers: they&#8217;re constantly buying new merchandise to replace the old. Subsequently, for those creating products for the youth market, fads help drive business. They may even help make you rich! You just have to develop a strong sense of when to jump on and off a fad, or you&#8217;ll be stuck with stock you can&#8217;t move. </p><p>Trends, on the other hand, are more enduring, often lasting for a decade or longer. In fact, some trends go mainstream and become more or less permanent. But unlike fads, trends take time to emerge. Trends often take a year or more to develop, and by the time they enter </p></div><p>our collective consciousness, often one or two trend watchers have as</p><p>signed names to these concepts. </p><p>One person who loves to assign names to new trends is Faith Popcorn, who owns a New York&#8211;based company called Brain Reserve (brainreserve.com), which helps a lot of big corporations, including Proctor &amp; Gamble and McDonald&#8217;s, get their trend bearings. Popcorn introduced the word &#8220;cocooning&#8221; in the beginning of the 1990s, when people started spending more time at home and started using their disposable income on home products. </p><p>Popcorn agrees with us about an important task for manufacturers and artisans: they must regularly visit stores in major market centers to spot emerging trends and fads, field trips she calls TrendTreking and Virtual TrendTreking (computer Web site searches to spot trends and fads). </p><p>In this chapter we&#8217;ll present some of the most important current and emerging trends to consider (in our opinion). Then we&#8217;ll give you a look at the new face of 21st-century American consumers. </p></div></div><div class="section"><h3><i>THE FUSION TREND </i></h3><p>Some call this cross-pollination while others call it multicultural fusion. Fusion adds zest to the design field. Today <i>everything </i>is getting mixed up in interesting ways. You see it in the food business with products such as kosher dim sum and beef teriyaki burritos. In the spirituality field it&#8217;s Christians and Jews incorporating Buddhist meditation or yoga practice into their lifestyles, or the numerous non-Jewish media stars practicing kabbalah and wearing the red string bracelets to signify their study. It&#8217;s the popular WWJD (What Would Jesus Do?) bracelets and T-shirts appearing, then morphing into WWBD and WWMD (Buddha, Moses) products soon after. In the media field it&#8217;s Japanese and French rock mixed into today&#8217;s American hits, Spanish soap operas, and Uma Thurman&#8217;s Samurai-inspired sword fights in <i>Kill Bill, Volumes 1 &amp; 2. </i>In home furnishings it&#8217;s the well-placed Shiva sculpture and the African masks on the wall in an otherwise all-American-style home. In the fashion field one designer even introduced a clothing line based on Quaker styles. However, fusion isn&#8217;t always about mixing lifestyles: in some tabletop and furniture settings the fusion trend is based on mixing patterns or eras, not cultures. </p><div class="section"><p>Look for manufacturers of all types to be more daring with materi</p></div><p><i>36 </i><i>37 </i></p><div class="section"><p>als and ingredients previously thought to be unmixable as fusion becomes mainstream. </p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="section"><h3><i>THE SMART TREND </i></h3><p>Learning has been enhanced over the past ten to fifteen years. The Internet has made researching any topic easy, convenient, and fun. No wonder more people are doing it&#8212;and getting smarter at the same time. Leap Pads and other learning products from the toy industry are propelling young minds, which, coupled with the Harry Potter craze, have helped generate a strong base for children&#8217;s books. </p><p>At the university level, women now make up the majority of students. African-Americans have had the biggest jump in graduation levels in the past ten years: 80% now have high school degrees (10% higher than in 1990), and they&#8217;ve increased their college degrees to over 25% (a 5% increase in the past decade). </p><p>Until recently, e-learning was not widely accepted as an alternative to classroom settings. Now many major universities have joined the e-learning revolution, making it easier to take more classes, finish up a degree, or even get an advanced degree. </p><p>Pam Danziger, author of <i>Why People Buy Things They Don&#8217;t Need, </i>agrees that education is a big factor and notes that &#8220;the more education Americans get, the more they want.&#8221; She mentions books and other reading materials, art, computers and software, and entertainment products among the items that do well for this segment of the market. To that list we would add travelware, cerebral hobby items (such as telescopes and science sets), products for healthier living, and other discretionary items that a bigger paycheck can help buy. </p><p>Look for education to truly become a lifelong quest and for educational products to do well. </p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="section"><h3><i>THE HOME TREND </i></h3><p>This could also be called the &#8220;home as work of art&#8221; trend. At one time, people purchased houses, fixed them up, and were happy to live in them for ten or twenty years. Not today! Nowadays, home owners are remodeling and redecorating <i>constantly</i>. Donna Warner, the editor-inchief of <i>Metropolitan Home, </i>calls them &#8220;serial remodelers.&#8221; </p></div><div class="section"><p>In 2003 Americans spent $130.4 billion remodeling their houses </p></div><p>and condos, according to Harvard&#8217;s Joint Center for Housing Studies. The center also reported that this figure was a hefty 7.3% increase over the previous year. Along with the remodeling, new furniture is being bought at a similar rate. By the end of 2004, according to the industry publication <i>HFN, </i>consumer furniture spending was projected to be up 6.8%. Sales for 2005 were expected to be up another 6%. </p><p>Add to that our 21st-century lifestyles, which include the desire for entertaining-size kitchens, spa-inspired baths, home theaters, and mammoth closets. Is it any wonder that the average home is now 2,200 square feet&#8212;50% larger than it was just thirty years ago? </p><p>This trend is driven by our continuing desire to cocoon in uncertain times. Additionally, our exposure to so many interior designer and building contractor &#8220;trade secrets&#8221; on television and in magazines helps us determine precisely how to personalize our private spaces. We know what we want, and our homes reflect that individuality. </p><p>One of the big media successes of this trend is HGTV, based in Knoxville, Tennessee. One of the fastest-growing stations in cable history, it reaches over 80 million households in the United States each day. The company also owns 33% of their popular offshoot, HGTV Canada, and some of its shows are available in locations as diverse as Japan, Slovakia, Thailand, and the Philippines. The popularity of cable home-decorating shows is being watched carefully by the networks. ABC, the first to add one to their prime-time schedule, calls their <i>Extreme Makeover: Home Edition </i>a &#8220;ratings-rich reality series.&#8221; Their concept is grand scale compared to cable fare: a home is completely made over, inside and out, in just seven days for a worthy family. </p></div><div class="section"><h3><i>THE INSTANT GRATIFICATION TREND </i></h3><p>Americans have always wanted things fast. But our impatience has reached a new level&#8212;especially in the food marketplace. We not only want food <i>fast, </i>we want it to be <i>great </i>fast food. Want sushi? Have it made for you in seconds at the grocery store or find a fast food sushi outlet where you simply walk around the shop choosing prepacked delicacies. Quality prepackaged meals offer the ability to make lunch or dinner in ten to twenty minutes maximum. </p><p>You can now do your dry cleaning and develop pictures at home if you don&#8217;t have time to run errands. Saving time, even a few minutes </p><p><i>38 </i><i>39 </i></p><div class="section"><p>here and there, is a luxury people are willing to pay for. Some banks even offer additional services inside their doors, such as Starbucks, take-out restaurants, postal/printing shops, and dry cleaning services, allowing busy customers to multitask and save precious time. Try it once, and you&#8217;re hooked! </p><p>We&#8217;ve learned to expect instant gratification in the use of numerous computerized gadgets, including camera cell phones, iPods, Tivos, and the soon-to-be-popular IPTV (Internet protocol television). We&#8217;ve grown to love these aids, which provide information or entertainment on demand. And while cable TV is good, IPTV will redefine the experience, offering limitless channels, multiple viewing options, and the ability to interact with telecom services. Talking about the new IPTV technology with <i>Business Week </i>in February 2005, Bill Gates, whose company will control a large part of that emerging business, said, &#8220;We persevered, and now both on the cable and telco side we found a way for our software to fit and improve the TV experience.&#8221; </p><p>If your product can enhance a daily ritual or shave even a few minutes off a daily chore or an unpleasant task, today&#8217;s consumers will want it. Get busy and produce it! </p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="section"><h3><i>THE SAFETY TREND </i></h3><p>Twenty years from now we&#8217;ll wonder how people ever lived the security-lax lives we enjoy today. It&#8217;s an area that will experience (you&#8217;ll excuse the term) <i>explosive growth</i>. </p><p>On the home front, it&#8217;s not just security systems that are making Americans feel safer. Once only for the wealthy, self-fortressing has become the choice of many. Sam Hill notes in his book <i>60 Trends in 60 Minutes </i>that our country now has over 20,000 gated communities, compared to approximately 2,000 just thirty years ago. </p><p>But much of the new security will focus on public spaces and will eventually be visible everywhere we go. While eye scans likely won&#8217;t gain popularity (people are afraid of them), look for thumb and hand scanning to become commonplace. </p><p>We have friends working in the public security arena, and what we see coming is light-years ahead of today&#8217;s devices. The lie-detector test, easy to evade, is already being replaced in some areas by machinery that will accurately test employees, educators, and people crossing </p></div><div class="section"><p>borders for truthfulness to help determine what they are <i>inclined </i>to do. </p></div><p>(Think Tom Cruise in <i>Minority Report</i>.)

(2) They know when to ask for help and how to use it to grow a struggling business. (3) They know how to work the celebrity angle to their advantage. (4) They excel at packaging and promotions. (5) And they&#8217;ve built their business around fun&#8212;which is apparent to anyone who visits their West Coast factory, Midwest warehouse, or international Web site (available in five languages). </p><p>Current company president, Herman G. &#8220;Herm&#8221; Rowland, grandson of Herman Goelitz, the company&#8217;s founder, approached America&#8217;s free business counseling service SCORE<sup>&#174; </sup>in the early 1960s with a problem. At the time, the Herman Goelitz Candy Company produced great confections but was barely eking out a profit. The SCORE counselor, known simply as Mr. McDaniel, worked weekly for two years with Rowland and his company to help them reposition, then secure a loan for the updates their facility needed. </p><p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no doubt that Mr. McDaniel&#8217;s efforts helped save our family&#8217;s company, because he gave me real-life solutions to address our challenges,&#8221; notes a thankful Rowland. &#8220;He also taught me that to be successful, you have to think in terms of &#8216;us&#8217; and &#8216;we,&#8217; not &#8216;I&#8217; and &#8216;me.&#8217; That was a small mental adjustment, but it really woke me up to the importance of teamwork and commitment.&#8221; </p></div><div class="section"><p><i>41 </i></p><p>gymnasts, or deer hunters) or a broader group (grade school students, cooks, or commuters).

The candy maker dedicated a great deal of effort to make certain its Jelly Belly<sup>&#174; </sup>line would not be confused with standard jelly beans by packaging each flavor separately&#8212;a bold and very successful move. The candy soon became popular with the public and many celebrities, then rode the ultimate success wave when Jelly Belly fan Ronald Reagan entered the White House and kept a constant supply of the beans on his Oval Office desk. During Reagan&#8217;s election year (1980), Jelly Belly sales climbed from $2.9 to million $4.6 million. </p><p>Today 100,000 pounds of Jelly Bellies are made each day, with each bean going through a machine that stamps the brand name on 20,700 beans per minute. Jelly Bellies maintain 50 &#8220;official&#8221; flavors, some coming and going to make room for &#8220;rookie flavors,&#8221; which currently include roasted garlic and cinnamon toast. The company eventually changed their name to match that of their most famous product, even though they continue to produce many other popular candies. </p><p>During tours, visitors can watch Jelly Bellies being made and stamped, see fun versions of major art work made out of Jelly Bellies, and then stop by the factory&#8217;s candy store, which is filled with all the company&#8217;s sweets and other products that bear the company&#8217;s logo. On their Web site, everything Jelly Belly is spotlighted, including Martha Stewart&#8217;s beautiful Jelly Belly wedding cake and the company&#8217;s new success promoting Jelly Bellies as &#8220;wedding beans.&#8221; </p><p>Kids everywhere are right: the fun never stops at the candy factory. In this case fun is part of a grand family tradition that continues to thrive. </p></div><p>credible sources as ages 8 to 12, 9 to 13, and 10 to 12. Previously called </p><p>&#8220;preteens,&#8221; theirs has always been an awkward, in-between stage, but now they&#8217;re finally being addressed by manufacturers and marketers as a separate category. Products are being developed for them that are neither juvenile nor as sophisticated as teen items. It&#8217;s a fine line, but one worth pursuing if you are developing products for kids or teens, as you can hold onto or grab their market share earlier. In a report titled <i>Hitting the Target </i>for Efficient Consumer Response Management, Laura Bates reports that the number of tweens is currently growing at a faster rate than the U.S. population as a whole. &#8220;This group is spending 57.8% more than their predecessors. They spend an average of $18 per shopping trip,&#8221; Bates notes. &#8220;Tweens account for $48 billion in spending per year, using over $15 billion of their own money.&#8221; </p><p>Teens, a far larger group, have even more spending power. According to Teenage Research Unlimited, their average spending was $104 per week in the early 21st century, with two-thirds spent at their discretion and the rest spend on specific needs, such as meals. </p><p>Speaking of food, more teens are becoming vegetarians. According to the American Dietetic Association, 30% more are calling themselves vegetarians than did just ten years ago. </p><p>One chain that caters very well to the tween and teen market segments is Claire&#8217;s, the fun fashion accessories store. Their shops are always great destinations for these age groups because their products are fun, fashionable, and dirt cheap. Tweens and teens can get a lot for their money&#8212;and that&#8217;s exactly what they&#8217;re looking for. </p></div><div class="section"><h5><i>It&#8217;s a Hip-Hop World </i></h5><p>Hip-hop music had its beginnings more than twenty-five years ago in New York and now accounts for over 11% of music sales (more than $90 million), according to a report by SoundScan, a company that follows music sales. SoundScan also notes that by the mid-1990s, over 75% of hip-hop music sales were to white consumers. </p><p>Despite all the critics who thought it was a passing fad, hip-hop has thrived, encompassing many other aspects of our culture, including language, dance, and clothing. A PBS documentary, &#8220;Hip Hop Style: What is Cool?&#8221;, showed how important it has become when they noted that Tommy Hilfiger&#8217;s profits soared by more than $90 million the year the company introduced hip-hop styling to their clothing line. </p><p><i>42 </i><i>43 </i></p><div class="section"><p>Yes, it&#8217;s mainstream here, and <i>Black Enterprise </i>magazine calls it &#8220;America&#8217;s leading cultural export.&#8221; </p><p>Here in the United States, hip-hop also defines a generation (primarily 15- to 25-year-olds) who has experienced a world on shaky ground. Most have lived through a series of unsettling, frightening page-one stories, from school shootings to 9/11 to Iraq. </p><p>These consumers often view marketing and advertising with a skeptical eye. A clean, direct approach is best, with a little humor thrown in for good measure. Words like &#8220;new and improved&#8221; or &#8220;now on sale&#8221; seem like lies to them. Honesty will win you points and possibly sales, too. </p><p>They view the items of the 1950s to 1970s as previous generation&#8217;s cherished keepsakes. So don&#8217;t expect many of them to warm up to older styling, to frilly, romantic looks, or to any product that looks too established. Williams-Sonoma, which owns Pottery Barn, has rolled out an exceptional catalog and stores called West Elm to help satisfy this market segment. Their executives believe that it may become their strongest offering. </p><p>Even Starbucks has had to create a whole new division of stores with young people in mind. The company started rolling out Hear Music Coffeehouses/Media Bars in Santa Monica and Berkeley, California, with more to follow. The stores offer listening bars where customers can hear over 10,000 CDs featuring the latest hits and emerging artists, create a custom mix, and burn a CD. Starbucks created the Hear Music division after a study revealed that many potential customers in this age group view their original store concept as too corporate. </p><p>The hip-hop generation is more savvy than previous generations were at their age. Their exposure to various art forms through the media and computers makes them comfortable with bold color usage and more creative styling. </p><p>Don&#8217;t look for this age group to grow up and join the establishment in the same way previous generations did. They just don&#8217;t have the mind-set to do so. Yet on many fronts, they are a generation that marketers forget. According to a February 2005 report in <i>Newsweek, </i>&#8220;The hip-hop generation is full of influential tastemakers.&#8221; Merrill Lynch&#8217;s Jessica Reif-Cohen, interviewed for that report, noted, &#8220;It&#8217;s a giant segment of the population that&#8217;s clearly underserved.&#8221; If you can create stylish apparel, media, and other consumer products for this group, do it! </p></div><div class="section"/></div><div class="section"><h5><i>The Aging Nicely Generation </i></h5><p>The Nielson ratings and other rating systems tell their television network clients that they should cater to consumers age 18 to 49 because older consumers are set in their ways and less inclined to purchase new products. Lately, many published reports question that rationale. Times have changed: Americans are living an average of ten to fifteen years longer than a century ago. Fifty is what forty used to be&#8212;and people well into their seventies and eighties lead active lives, look younger, and work to stay that way. And that takes money! According to MarketResearch.com, Americans are purchasing cosmeceuticals (enhanced beauty and other anti-aging products) at a rate of $12.4 billion a year&#8212;and that&#8217;s not all they&#8217;re buying. </p><p>Many empty nesters have a lot of disposable income, and they&#8217;re not just saving it. They&#8217;re traveling, investing in second homes, or building retirement homes that are in no way scaled down. Numerous studies show that many are as open to trying new products as younger age groups. </p><p>There are currently more than 35 million Americans over the age of 65. By 2025, seniors will account for one of every six Americans, so get used to courting this growing market. Few of them feel or act old. Don&#8217;t make the mistake of thinking they are. </p><p>Manufacturers who court people in this very broad age range simply need to make a few adjustments to their thinking. Get used to using bigger print on packaging and product manuals. If your product warrants it, apply ergonomic standards to what you create. Work with an aging consultant to make certain your items are easy to open or pick up. Few consumers will notice these subtle changes. They&#8217;ll still look just as attractive, but they&#8217;ll also appeal to a wider audience, bringing increased sales. </p></div><div class="section"><h5><i>Older, Wealthier Parents; Younger, Poorer Children </i></h5><p>Americans are getting married later, having fewer children, and often having them later in life. Having a first child after age forty was considered a novelty when Murphy Brown had one fifteen years ago on television. Now it&#8217;s commonplace for women to push the age limit for parenthood. All this accounts for parents with more disposable income (from extra years spent in the workforce). And from English prams to designer clothing to preschools with prices that rival college </p><p><i>44 </i><i>45 </i></p><div class="section"><p>tuition, many of these older, more established parents are spending money on their children that far exceeds what was spent on previous generations. </p><p>Manufacturers, artisans, and retailers are responding with more furnishing and clothing options. Children&#8217;s furniture design leaders such as Posh Tots, Bellini, and Mitchell Gold have been followed by major chains, such as Williams-Sonoma&#8217;s newer divisions, Pottery Barn Kids and PB Teen. Creative children&#8217;s clothing company Gymboree has expanded by adding another division, Janie and Jack, which caters to younger customers (from birth to 4T) with fashions their company describe as &#8220;distinctive, precious clothing and accessories with a handmade, luxurious quality.&#8221; The company now has well over 600 premium children&#8217;s stores across the United States and Canada. </p><p>Unfortunately, there&#8217;s a flip side to this: a whopping 17.6% of all of our country&#8217;s children are living below the poverty line. This sad number is fueled by single parenthood and by families that live in rural areas where the economies have dried up, leaving few well-paying jobs. Many of these families cannot afford to buy their children new clothing or even school supplies. Children, it seems, are our new poor, especially in inner cities and in rural areas. Several reports cite rural factory jobs lost to overseas operations as one of the culprits, leaving many young parents without work and unwilling to leave their extended families for jobs in other regions. No matter the reason, we hope more manufacturers will step up to the plate and create quality products for this market segment because the need is great. </p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="section"><h5><i>So, Tell Me About Yourself . . . </i></h5><p>Multiethnicity is growing, and the results are more children and adults who slide easily between two religions, two cultures, or two races (sometimes even more). This is part of the bigger fusion trend. California leads the way, where multiethnic marriages represent approximately one in five. </p><p>According to the Association of MultiEthnic Americans (ameasite .org), 2 to 3% of Americans identify with more than one racial heritage. Add to that Americans raised in homes with dual religious and cultural traditions, and the number goes way, way up. </p><p>According to the Mavin Foundation (mavinfoundation.org), another ethnic pluralism advocacy group, the 2000 Census marked the </p></div><div class="section"><p>first time Americans of multiple ethnicities could be counted, and 7 </p></div><p>million Americans marked this category, a dramatic demographic shift. </p><p>Mavin&#8217;s Web site notes, &#8220;Today, in cities like Seattle, Sacramento, and San Antonio, 1 in 6 babies born is multiracial. And yet, despite this national mixed race baby boom, few people are aware of the unique needs of this rapidly growing community.&#8221; </p><p>For many within this fast-growing group, not falling into a specific ethnic category has made them transparent in both our society and our marketplace. This creates many opportunities for smart manufacturers and artisans who understand and support diversity in their work. Christmas-Hanukkah cards and fusion foods such as kosher Chinese take-out are already in the marketplace. Yet we&#8217;re still not seeing enough diversity in product development in other categories, and new immigrants and ethnically loyal consumers still don&#8217;t see themselves well represented in many areas, including the doll market (which is crucial to instilling confidence). Mix it up! What can you bring to the marketplace that is cross-cultural and will inspire pride? </p></div><div class="section"><h5><i>Men as Shoppers </i></h5><p>According to tradition, women consumers have always driven the U.S. marketplace and controlled household spending, while most men found shopping a chore. Now, slowly but surely, men are taking their position as retail decision-makers. According to a report titled <i>U.S. Men&#8217;s Market </i>from MarketResearch.com, &#8220;Radical changes in the role of women in society over the past four decades inevitably have caused corresponding changes . . . The blurring of strict gender differences in roles and relationships has a significant impact on consumer behavior in 21st century America.&#8221; With more stay-at-home dads, more married men sharing household responsibilities, and younger generations viewing shopping malls as great places to hang out, look for real changes in men&#8217;s overall attitudes toward all types of shopping from now on. </p><p>And the changes aren&#8217;t just in brick and mortar settings. Men excel as Internet shoppers. Ecommerce-Guide recently reported on an America Online study of 6,200 shoppers. For the 2004 holiday season, online shopping by men was 15% higher than that of women. During the year, men spent an average of $204 on Internet goods monthly compared to women&#8217;s $186. </p><p>An MSN<sup>&#174;</sup>UK report reveals that the pattern change is becoming universal. According to the report by Matt Ball titled <i>Why Men Are Better Shoppers Than Women, </i>&#8220;They (men) enjoy it more. This is be</p><p><i>46 </i><i>47 </i></p><div class="section"><p>cause men buy more of what they actually need and see shopping trips as a functional exercise rather than an emotional journey.&#8221; </p><p>Paco Underhill, author of <i>Why We Buy, The Science of Shopping, </i>disagrees with the &#8220;enjoy&#8221; aspect of male shopping. His book has a chapter on men consumers in which he explains, &#8220;You&#8217;ll see a man moving through a store to the section he wants, pick something up, and then, almost as abruptly, he&#8217;s ready to buy, having taken no apparent joy in the process of finding.&#8221; Underhill notes that the sexes differ in another way: &#8220;Eighty-six percent of women look at price tags when they shop. Only 72% of men do.&#8221; </p><p>You can see that consumer models have changed through the years and the evolution continues. This century&#8217;s shoppers will be more diverse, better educated, more savvy, and likely more demanding of retailers and their vendors. Unless your products will appeal only to a single segment of the market (babies or seniors, for instance), make certain your goods and packaging have broad appeal. However, those of you catering to the niche markets, such as the ones mentioned here and in chapter 1, may be the luckiest.

And people of all ages who never even cared about their health are finally joining the fit-and-trim movement. Whether it&#8217;s soy shakes, mineral and vitamin compounds, or cosmetics, lotions, and potions, we see many opportunities for companies with something fresh. We see young companies succeed here regularly. But don&#8217;t just bring a repackaged line into this wide sea of products. </p><p>Cosmetics are being offered with enhanced skin nutrition (called cosmeceuticals) and aromatherapy qualities&#8212;even at the supermarket and drug store levels. Cosmetics, hair care, and skin care are currently a $12.4 billion (and growing) industry in the United States, according to a report by PackagedFacts.com. Other reports note that the ethnic-specific cosmetic market now exceeds $1.5 billion a year, while the sun care and lip balm market tops out at $1 billion. </p><p>We give the beauty care and health markets a: <i>GREEN LIGHT </i></p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="section"><h3><i>BEVERAGE MARKET </i></h3><p>The huge beverage market is reporting some notable changes, such as those noted below. </p><p>While overall bottled water sales continue to rise, the huge growth is in enhanced waters (those that add flavors or vitamins, etc.), where sales are already over $245 million annually. Initially dominated by great-tasting but sugary blends, the bright spotlight is now on those that add flavor without adding calories. For instance, according to <i>New Nutrition Business </i>magazine, sales of Fruit 2.0 rose from $15 million in </p></div><div class="section"><p>2001 to over $100 million by 2004. Through their own &#8220;enhanced&#8221; ad</p></div><p>vertising efforts in 2005, their sales margins are likely to grow again&#8212; </p><p>likely at the expense of calorie-laden water products. </p><p>Meanwhile, the average American drinks over 800 servings of soda a year (up almost 20% from the mid-1980s). Dietary concerns have helped diet sodas slowly grow to 27% of that industry&#8217;s $64 billion market. Several industry experts believe diet sodas will eventually reign over their sugar-packed cousins. Expect the still-new half-sugar, half&#8211;artificial sweetener sodas to bump down regular soda sales, too. However, fruit-flavored sodas, always popular with children, are in a growth phase, too: there the spotlight is on small, boutique bottler&#8217;s products, such as Izze Beverage&#8217;s &#8220;sparkling juices&#8221; or Switch Beverage Company&#8217;s exotic, adult flavors (including Cranberry Ginger). Both are marketing their sodas, also called health beverages, in vintage-style bottles. Others, like 7 UP, are also developing enhanced products. </p><p>Tea sales are up by 15%, too, due in part to RTDs (ready-to-drink) that took the work and wait out of brewing. But sales are also up due to baby boomers who have embraced all types of tea for its health benefits. </p><p>The coffee market remains robust, with recent annual sales reported at $9.2 billion retail with another $8.7 billion in the food service sector, according to coffeeresearch.org. They also report that over half of Americans drink coffee regularly, with almost 20% now preferring gourmet brands. </p><p>Drinks, anyone? According to a recent government report titled <i>Consumer Expenditures on Alcohol, </i>the answer is definitely &#8220;yes.&#8221; Americans spend $1 on alcohol for every $8 they spend on food, and they consume 24.9 gallons of alcoholic beverages per year (mostly beer). </p><p>Once flat, hard liquor sales are up. Mixed drinks are once again in vogue, with a specific flavor&#8217;s popularity often driven by fads and even the media. For instance, cosmopolitans were made popular by <i>Sex in the City </i>but plummeted soon after the show ended. Micro-breweries are doing well; many are going mainstream. Anheiser Busch is courting the 20-something market with an enhanced beer with a buzz, B<sup>E</sup>, which features caffeine, ginseng, and guarana. Meanwhile, quality vintners of all sizes are doing just fine, but a glut in wine&#8217;s mass market has made the competition fierce there. </p><p>We give the bottled water, soda, and tea markets a: <i>GREEN LIGHT </i>We give the rest of the beverage market an: <i>AMBER LIGHT </i></p><p><i>50 </i><i>51 </i></p><div class="section"/></div><div class="section"><div class="section"><h3><i>BOOK AND CALENDAR MARKET </i></h3><p>In certain categories the book market is stronger than ever. It seems that Harry Potter started kids of all ages on a reading quest (well over 100 million books sold worldwide so far). The category is also hot for a slew of celebrity children&#8217;s authors, including Madonna, Billy Crystal, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Maria Shriver. More than ever, young children and tweens are picking up books, and it&#8217;s likely they&#8217;ll continue their reading ways into adulthood. </p><p>The adult reading market is also booming in certain categories. Religion and spirituality tomes have experienced impressive increases, as has (dare we say it?) the business book market. Also showing no sign of abating are the health/diet category and cookbooks, which many now read for pleasure instead of as recipe sources. </p><p>According to the Book Industry Study Group, annual consumer spending on books should reach $44 billion by 2008. </p><p>The incentive market took a big bite out of the regular calendar market in the early 2000s. But now they&#8217;ve moved on to other goods, so the market for store-bought calendars is returning, though the use of Palm Pilots, BlackBerrys, and other devices will continue to erode sales. In the paper calendar market we&#8217;d like to see some new themes and images, such as multimedia calendars or some with smart graphics or with snappy verbiage. If you&#8217;ve got ideas that have mass appeal, go for it! </p><p>We give the book market a: <i>GREEN LIGHT </i></p><p>We give the calendar market an: <i>AMBER LIGHT </i></p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="section"><h3><i>CASUAL APPAREL MARKET </i></h3><p>Despite a growing need, there is little new in this massive, multibillion-dollar market. We wonder why more product producers aren&#8217;t using wick fabrics (to keep active people dry) and other enhanced fabrics, including those that offer sunscreen protection, insect protection, and germ resistance. This market is really driven by the latest color trends, the latest fads, and not much else. However, that&#8217;s likely not enough for new lines in a market dominated by a few huge players. Yet opportunities to come into this market and <i>WOW! </i>consumers are out there for truly original lines. </p></div><div class="section"><p>We give the casual clothing market an: <i>AMBER LIGHT </i></p></div><div class="section"><p><i>WHY TRULY NEW PRODUCTS ARE NEEDED </i></p><p>When asked about the number of <i>personally valuable </i>innovations they had seen in the last couple of years, upward of 50 percent of consumers said they saw <i>none</i>, and up to 70 percent saw either none or only one or two in each category tested. This was especially true for those with household incomes over $100,000. These customers saw significantly less valuable innovation in nearly every category. </p><p><i>&#8212;PAUL NUNES AND BRIAN JOHNSON Mass Affluence: 7 New Rules of Marketing to Today&#8217;s Consumer </i></p></div></div><div class="section"><h3><i>CHILDREN&#8217;S MARKET (ALSO SEE BOOK MARKET) </i></h3><p>Certain categories within the children&#8217;s market are very strong, including children&#8217;s furnishings (note the recent success of Pottery Barn Kid and PB Teen in chapter 1). Meanwhile, high-end children&#8217;s furniture stores Bellini and Land of Nod are expanding into teen furniture, allowing them to keep their customers longer. Overall, the children&#8217;s furniture market exceeded $1.1 billion last year, according to <i>Kids Today</i>. </p><p>Toys are another matter. No-tech and low-tech toy sales are flat beyond the toddler market, though certain items are becoming collectibles for adults (including some doll lines, plush items, and toys that evoke a sense of nostalgia.) Meanwhile, toys in the tech realm are strong. Children simply seem to be graduating earlier to high-tech devices. Don&#8217;t expect this trend to reverse itself. Author Sam Hill has applied a name to this phenomenon in his book <i>60 Trends in 60 Minutes</i>. He calls it &#8220;prematurity,&#8221; a name we find very appropriate for today&#8217;s children, who often seem to be growing up too fast. </p><p>Children&#8217;s clothing is thriving in the mid and high ends of the market. Like furniture, parents and grandparents are lavishing children with more clothing than most need. Style and color are the fun elements here, so be creative. </p><p>You may remember from chapter 4 that there is a great need for more affordable designs throughout the children&#8217;s marketplace because 17.6% of children in our country fall below the poverty line. Innovative, fun, and affordable products will be very welcome in this segment of the children&#8217;s market. </p><p><i>52 </i></p><div class="section"><p><i>53<br/></i></p><p>We give the overall children&#8217;s market a: <i>GREEN LIGHT </i></p><p>We give the tech toy market a: <i>GREEN LIGHT </i></p><p>We give the traditional toy market a: <i>RED LIGHT </i></p><p>We give the children&#8217;s clothing market a: <i>GREEN LIGHT </i></p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="section"><h3><i>COLLECTIBLES MARKET </i></h3><p>Recently one of us ran into a man who makes his living importing collectible spoons and plates. Our <i>grandmothers </i>collected those! Our generation and those to come likely won&#8217;t. In fact, the entire concept of collectibles and antiques will be dramatically altered in this decade and the next. What&#8217;s retro today (from the 1950s to 1970s) will be the preferred antiques of today&#8217;s youth. While they may be collecting sports and media memorabilia and fad items, don&#8217;t look for them to collect knickknacks and dainties when they grow up. Those categories are too old-fashioned for today&#8217;s aesthetics. </p><p>We give the collectibles market an: <i>AMBER LIGHT </i></p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="section"><h3><i>CRAFT MARKET </i></h3><p>This market is huge, covering a wide variety of product categories, so the sales numbers are difficult to define. Though the technology now exists for manufacturers to duplicate the efforts of artisans (especially in the home furnishings market), this field is flourishing. There&#8217;s nothing like a handmade, limited-edition piece to set us and our homes apart. However, look for the directions artisans take to become more sophisticated and for them to become more savvy about their business skills. In chapter 22, Advice from the Pros, Reed J. McMillan of the American Craft Council notes, &#8220;Crafting is an outdated word, reminiscent of the 1960s. Consumers are smarter about styles now. They&#8217;re looking for something that adds to the quality of life.&#8221; The craft field, once a hippie haven, is growing up. </p><p>We give the craft market an: <i>AMBER LIGHT </i></p></div></div><div class="section"><h3><i>DESIGN MARKET (CONTEMPORARY DESIGN) </i></h3><p>After an explosion during the late 1980s and early 1990s, this field has settled down somewhat. It hasn&#8217;t become complacent; it&#8217;s just that customers who were (finally) introduced to the major designers of the past (Le Corbusier, Eames, Mackintosh, etc.) now want to be charmed by something brand-new. While there are many excellent companies in this field, there isn&#8217;t a movement that excites us the way Memphis did during the 1980s. Instead, we&#8217;re seeing a lot of excellent products based on retro styling. Also exciting is the fact that fashion designers are designing furniture and architects are designing more home accessory lines. Maybe there&#8217;s hope for a new wave on the home front after all! </p><div class="section"><p>We give the contemporary design market a: <i>GREEN LIGHT </i></p></div></div><div class="section"><h3><i>FRAGRANCE AND AROMATHERAPY MARKET </i></h3><p>Remember when we thought aromatherapy was a fad? Now it&#8217;s mainstream and has slowly but surely trickled down to middle America, and into the men&#8217;s market as well. Yet many of today&#8217;s new products are seldom really different. We believe sales in this market will continue to climb for some time; but look for big box and other mass retailers to take a bite out of the pie, driving prices down. </p><p>Meanwhile, the fragrance market remains steady, with few new names and faces. It continues to be a very expensive field to enter, unless a new line can be backed with massive advertising funds. </p><p>We give the fragrance and aromatherapy market an: <i>AMBER LIGHT </i></p></div><div class="section"><h3><i>FURNITURE AND HOME ACCESSORIES MARKET<br/>(ALSO SEE OUTDOOR/GARDEN/PATIO<br/>MERCHANDISE MARKETS)<br/></i></h3><p>With so much product being outsourced to China and other parts of Asia, this market is going through some major changes. Those creating and producing stateside will form more alliances with &#8220;made in America&#8221; groups to promote their goods as homegrown. There may eventually even be a certain cachet to making products in the United States, even though the quality of goods made abroad will continue to rise. </p><p><i>54 </i><i>55 </i></p><div class="section"><p>On the other hand, home accessories are doing well but seldom impress us creatively. It&#8217;s difficult to create something new in this highly developed field. We see major growth in the outdoor movement, in which people want their outdoors to become an extension of their indoors. In California, outdoor bedrooms, living and dining rooms, and kitchens are really taking off. This will influence the casual furniture market, which will start to mimic the regular furniture market. </p><p>We give the furniture market a: <i>GREEN LIGHT </i></p><p>We give the home accessories market a: <i>RED LIGHT </i></p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="section"><h3><i>FOOD: GENERAL AND GOURMET MARKETS </i></h3><p>While the food industry has gone through health kicks before, this one is likely here to stay. That&#8217;s because Americans of all ages, including young Americans, are extremely overweight. Government reports indicate that 90% of Americans will be obese by 2030 unless we drastically change the ways we eat and exercise. </p><p>Foods and beverages with healthy ingredients will be the big winners of the future. Fast food restaurants and even Krispy Kreme Doughnuts<sup>&#174; </sup>have felt the pressure to change their menus and recipes to accommodate the wave of change in eating patterns. School vending machines across the country are replacing candy bars and sodas with fresh fruit, juices, and carrot sticks. In some states and many school districts, healthy snacks and lunch menus are now the law. </p><p>This doesn&#8217;t mean snacks are going away. As we eat more small meals on the run, snacks have become one of the most important categories in supermarkets and convenience stores. The new self-heating packaging from OnTech/Sonoco (ontech.com) which can heat foods and beverages to 145&#176;F within minutes will soon futher enhance our ability to conveniently snack anywhere/anytime. </p><p>Health concerns and interest in high-protein/low-carb eating have pushed sales of prepared breakfast foods up, while cereal sales have gone down, according to a report from MarketResearch.com. </p><p>The splurges of the future will likely be on the really good stuff: downright decadent chocolates, cakes, sauces, and snack items. Americans will be retrained to view these treats as occasional indulgences. But while their market may ebb, it will still be worth millions. So, tread </p></div><div class="section"><p>lightly if you plan to create a line of high-fat, high-carb, high-calorie </p></div><p>foods. You&#8217;ll be entering the market as many consumers begin looking </p><p>for alternatives to those products. </p><p>Gourmet takeout is another red-hot category for supermarkets, and there&#8217;s no reason why more of these products can&#8217;t expand from the local to the regional and national markets. Many markets have added piping hot &#8220;homemade&#8221; soup, prepacked sushi-to-go, gourmet pizzas, and other items to accommodate our expanded palates and to help grocers compete with carryout restaurants. Vacuum packing and express shipping allow innovative product producers to ship fresh or perishable items almost anywhere. Look for fresh-prepared, prepackaged foods to own a huge and growing segment of the grocery and convenience food market. </p><p>Enhanced foods and juices are now everywhere. The popular energy bar market has been growing approximately 20% a year for the past five years. And while most people never warmed to low-fat foods, they have to low-carb. Unfortunately, too many food producers jumped into the low-carb market, creating a glut of products there&#8212; some that put their market entry date ahead of taste! Look for only the best products in this category to survive and thrive. </p><p>The Food Marketing Institute also notes that eight out of ten shoppers say they eat ethnic meals at least twice a month (especially 15- to 39-year-olds). Those numbers will continue to grow. </p><div class="section"><p>We give the grocery market an: <i>AMBER LIGHT </i>We give the health food market a: <i>GREEN LIGHT </i>We give the gourmet food market a: <i>GREEN LIGHT </i>for take</p></div><p>away grocery food and an <i>AMBER LIGHT </i>for regular packaged food We give the junk food market a: <i>RED LIGHT </i></p></div><div class="section"><h3><i>GREEN AND ORGANIC MERCHANDISE MARKET </i></h3><p>The first Earth Day was over thirty years ago, so many of us have grown up accustomed to caring about what happens to our planet. Look for this area, which for some reason still isn&#8217;t considered mainstream in many parts of the country, to finally make the big strides it should have long ago. Also look for the United States to finally bow to pressure from others to shape up our standing on global eco-issues. </p><p>As you develop your product, eco-correct is something you should always try to incorporate into your merchandise. Organic materials are used in so many product categories, including crafts, home furnishings, </p><p><i>56 </i><i>57 </i></p><div class="section"><p>clothing and shoes, stationery, and paper office products. According to the Organic Trade Association, U.S. sales of organic foods and beverages alone grew from $1 billion in 1990 to $10.4 billion in 2003. However, this represents just 2% of overall sales in those categories. Even with new labeling regulations clearly indicating what is and isn&#8217;t &#8220;organic,&#8221; expect to see more of the same growth patterns in this market. </p><p>We give the organic market an: <i>AMBER LIGHT </i></p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="section"><h3><i>HARDWARE AND HOME ARCHITECTURAL MARKET </i></h3><p>This market went through some dramatic changes in the 1990s, when manufacturers and retailers took a good look at their customer base and realized they had to start producing more female-friendly products to meet the growing demand. Manufacturers did a great job, and now the hardware marketplace offers a lot of colorful new products that have softened its image. Hardware stores have now become great shopping destinations for women, offering many great gift items&#8212; not just for Father&#8217;s Day but for Mother&#8217;s Day and wedding days as well. </p><p>Add the huge home renovations market (see chapter 4), and the hardware/home architectural market becomes a launching pad for many in the broad category of home improvement. Also look for more fiber optic installation to accommodate all the smart appliances that are now trickling and will soon be flowing into the home market (see housewares for more info). </p><p>We give the hardware and home architectural market a: <i>GREEN LIGHT </i></p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="section"><h3><i>HOUSEHOLD PRODUCTS MARKET </i></h3><p>This industry is experiencing explosive growth after years of stagnation. Much is due to the success of several initial offerings, such as Proctor &amp; Gamble&#8217;s Swiffer Sweeper, a popular mop for which consumers must continually buy replacement cloths. Following the concept of &#8220;give the razor away, but sell the blades,&#8221; other new products, many needing refills, are being rolled out this year. Proctor &amp; Gamble&#8217;s CEO Alan G. Lafley </p></div><div class="section"><p>believes his company&#8217;s new gadget approach will increase loyalty for </p></div><p>P&amp;G brands, and according to his company&#8217;s sales figures, their gadget </p><p>business grew by over 15% within the past year. Other new devices include Tide&#8217;s ultrasonic stain-removing gadget and Mr. Clean Auto Dry, which looks like an iron. In a mature market, these new products with add-on appeal are taking the ho-hum out of the cleaning world. </p><div class="section"><p>We give the household products market an: <i>AMBER LIGHT </i></p></div></div><div class="section"><h3><i>HOUSEWARES AND KITCHEN MARKET </i></h3><p>As in so many other industries, the middle part of this market seems to have dropped out. Now it&#8217;s either low-end, disposable goods at very affordable prices or quality high-end products that cost megabucks. </p><p>When you see consumers building pizza ovens and $1,000+ cappuccino machines into their walls or see others installing wine cellars and wine refrigeration in their kitchens, you know the gourmet market has hit new heights. In new homes across the country, kitchens are getting the royal treatment, not just as cooking centers but as social areas where these expensive gadgets can be showcased. </p><p>Meanwhile, certain kitchen gadgets are lagging: with prewashed, prepackaged salads and peeled carrots, the market simply doesn&#8217;t need as many salad spinners and vegetable peelers. Look to the grocery store shelves to forecast which products will be eliminated (or downsized) next as Americans demand more time-saving options. </p><p>But not everyone wants a bigger kitchen filled with neat gadgets and appliances. Another trend is toward appliances that are multifunctional and fit into smaller spaces. Sears is one of the companies that is leading the way, after winning a 2003 design award for their microwave/toaster combo. Other companies are combining mini-refrigerator/freezers with microwave ovens. So, where is the market for these smaller, multifunctional appliances? Think dorm rooms, senior living facilities, offices, and home offices&#8212;a sizable and growing market. </p><p>When developing products for this market, consider whether your item should incorporate &#8220;smart design.&#8221; For instance, some new microwave ovens and ranges have a smart chip that allows the owner to turn on the oven from their office computer or cell phone so a hot meal is waiting for them when they get home. Other microwave-oven smart chips read the bar codes on plastic and paper packaging, then cook that item to the manufacturer&#8217;s specifications. Not out yet, but likely coming, is a smart-chip measuring spoon that has been devel</p><p><i>58 </i><i>59 </i></p><div class="section"><p>oped at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It can tell you if you&#8217;ve used too much or too little salt, for instance, and allows you to adjust the recipe accordingly. Smart-chip technology will soon be all over our homes. Use it if you can. </p><p>We give the overall housewares market a: <i>GREEN LIGHT </i></p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="section"><h3><i>JEWELRY AND FASHION ACCESSORY MARKET </i></h3><p>It&#8217;s difficult to create products that are truly new in these categories, though the fine jewelry category is red hot, with sales of over $20 billion each year, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce. </p><p>More stores are adding fashion jewelry, too. The companies making the biggest splashes are those that work their marketing magic to create fad items and get the media (or media stars) to help promote them. Just remember, unless you&#8217;re creating luxurious classics, this market is driven by fads that often last six months to two years before drying up. You can&#8217;t play here unless you stay on top of the latest colors and materials. Plan on changing your line often. </p><p>Meanwhile, the fashion accessory field is filled with hits and misses. It is imperative to stay ahead of color and fabric trends to make certain your accessories match those featured on the runways in Paris, Milan and New York if you plan to cash in on the latest styles. </p><p>We give the jewelry and fashion accessory market a: <i>GREEN LIGHT </i></p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="section"><h3><i>LINEN MARKET </i></h3><p>The bed linen market has become much more sophisticated in recent years, thanks in part to Martha Stewart, who kept hyping higher thread counts. Also, the deep discounts within the quality bed market have allowed more Americans to purchase and experience the difference. It&#8217;s unlikely they&#8217;ll return to inferior bedding. Bed linen designs are also catching up with the more sophisticated European looks. Children&#8217;s, tweens&#8217;, and teens&#8217; bed linen patterns are so good that adults want to use them, too. Affordable and colorful contemporary designs, such as those featured by Garnet Hill and West Elm, are entering the mainstream. </p><p>The bath, kitchen, and table linen markets need to follow the lead </p></div><div class="section"><p>of the bed market, offering new concepts and patterns. We haven&#8217;t </p></div><p>seen much new in these categories for some time. We&#8217;re hoping that </p><p>Bardwil Linens&#8217; new contract with Dansk and the Michael Graves Design Group to produce table linens and kitchen textiles, slated to start appearing in stores in late 2005, will inspire others. They describe their new products as casual contemporary with some &#8220;quirky&#8221; designs. That&#8217;s the kind of edginess younger and sophisticated consumers will appreciate. </p><p>If you&#8217;re a designer planning to enter these fields, you&#8217;d better have something special, as all the main players are very well established. </p><div class="section"><p>We give the linen market an: <i>AMBER LIGHT </i></p></div></div><div class="section"><h3><i>MUSEUM-RELATED MERCHANDISE MARKET </i></h3><p>As we cover in an upcoming chapter, this market is explosive with new growth. Museum stores, their Web sites, and catalogs all seem to be in expansion mode, and museum product manufacturers are finding that other retail stores want to dabble in this area as well due to high interest from their customers. With children&#8217;s and science museums continuing to become more interactive, look for real interest in these product sectors. While this industry doesn&#8217;t publish its sales figures, they are huge. </p><div class="section"><p>We give the museum market a: <i>GREEN LIGHT </i></p></div></div><div class="section"><h3><i>OUTDOOR/GARDEN/PATIO MERCHANDISE MARKETS (ALSO SEE FURNITURE MARKET) </i></h3><p>We see major growth in these categories, as people want their outdoor spaces to look like their indoor rooms. The backyard, patio, and deck have become highly regarded extensions of the home. In California outdoor bedrooms, living rooms, kitchens, and dining gazebos are really taking off. Outdoor grills, some costing thousands of dollars, are becoming status symbols, as well as built-in outdoor ovens and fireplaces. According to the International Housewares Association, American spending for outdoor improvements topped $670 million last year, up from $400 million a decade ago. This growth, and the addition of standard furniture pieces for the outdoors, will influence the casual </p><p><i>60 </i><i>61 </i></p><div class="section"><p>furniture market, which will start to mimic indoor furniture styles more often. </p><p>Meanwhile, gardening continues to be one of this country&#8217;s top hobbies, with new and higher-quality products for gardeners popping up all the time to keep sales blooming. This is a great area in which to develop products, <i>if </i>you have fresh ideas. The market will only continue to grow! </p><p>Outdoor sports equipment of all sorts is another area of growth. Americans are serious about their leisure activities and are buying the equipment they need to enjoy precious downtime. </p><p>We give the outdoor, garden, and patio markets a: <i>GREEN LIGHT </i></p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="section"><h3><i>PET MARKET </i></h3><p>Pets are family members&#8212;and they&#8217;re being treated just as well as children in many households. In fact, the American Pet Products Manufacturers Association (APPMA) indicates that our pets outnumber us: there are 377.8 million pets versus 290+ million people in the United States, and 62% of our households own a pet. Cats (77.7 million) outnumber dogs (65 million), with fish tank pets outnumbering both (192 million). One in three households has a dog or a cat, making them by far the most popular animals in our care. </p><p>The APPMA also reports that U.S. pet spending doubled from $17 billion in 1994 to $34.3 billion in 2004. The pet product business now far exceeds many other important categories: it&#8217;s 60% larger than the toy industry and 33% larger than the candy industry. </p><p>Jay Leno may make fun of pet clothing on the <i>Tonight Show</i>, but it is a growing and viable market segment. Trendy (human) clothing retailer Anthropology featured pet sweaters as the sole items on the cover of their holiday 2004 catalog. Pet goggles protect our dogs&#8217; eyes from UV rays&#8212;and from bugs and dust on car trips. According to the APPMA, there is a huge demand for travel-friendly pet items and services. Pet toys are now often multifunctional, freshening breath or helping to keep teeth and gums healthy. </p><p>Beautifully packaged gourmet treats abound, but not only in pet stores. One of the reasons for this category&#8217;s massive growth is the entry of regular gift shops and gourmet stores into the fray.

Always a strong category in our country, it&#8217;s growing in some interesting ways. Our more diverse population has shared concepts that have spouted growth areas, such as home altar books and kabbalah bracelets (which quickly sold out at Target). Spiritual figures are showing up on lamps, clothing, refrigerator magnets, and Bobbleheads. The popularity of &#8220;What Would Jesus Do?&#8221; books, T-shirts, and jewelry soon crossed over to other religions that simply substituted their religious figure&#8217;s name. </p><p>Explosive growth in the religious-themed novel category (<i>The Red Tent, The Da Vinci Code, The Left Behind </i>series, etc.) has created opportunities for an assortment of product producers who have cashed in on the books&#8217; and movies&#8217; successes. Religious nonfiction books are doing well, too. Amazon.com alone carries almost 25,000 books on religion and over 10,000 on spiritualism. </p><p>However, this is one category where you really need to make certain your product is in good taste. We&#8217;ve seen several products that weren&#8217;t, and a major clothing company had a PR nightmare in 2004 over a T-shirt that some thought was anti-Semitic. Especially if you plan to use humor, be careful not to offend your potential customer base! </p><p>We give the spiritual and religious products market a: <i>GREEN LIGHT </i></p></div><div class="section"><h3><i>STATIONERY AND PARTY GOODS MARKET </i></h3><p>The 1980s and 1990s were the heyday for new product development in this field, a time of explosive growth. Today the market is doing just fine, even without a lot of truly new products. E-mail and the computer age have enhanced instead of hurt greeting card sales. In fact, according to the Greeting Card Association (GCA), 7 billion cards are </p><p><i>62 </i><i>63 </i></p><div class="section"><p>now purchased annually (a 20% increase in a decade) from over 2,500 card publishers. Holidays throughout the year account for 50% of the cards purchased. The GCA notes that women age 30 to 65 purchase 80% of greeting cards. Meanwhile, stationery itself is lagging. If you want to create stationery items, consider creating note cards instead of full-fledged stationery sheets, as busy consumers want to jot notes, not write letters. </p><p>The party goods market, while challenged by discounters, is still strong. In many parts of the country, parties for children, tweens, and teens have become huge events. Some parents are spending as much money today on graduations, bar/bat mitzvahs, and Quinceanera parties (celebrating Mexican-American girls coming-of-age at fifteen) as they used to reserve for their children&#8217;s weddings! In fact, ethnicity is a big growth area in all three of these market segments. However, party goods distribution channels are crucial. If you can&#8217;t find a good one, sell your concept to a company with clout. </p><p>We give the greeting card market an: <i>AMBER LIGHT </i></p><p>We give the stationery market a: <i>RED LIGHT </i></p><p>We give the party goods market a: <i>GREEN LIGHT </i></p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="section"><h3><i>TABLETOP MARKET </i></h3><p>We aren&#8217;t setting our tables the way our grandmothers did, and likely never will again. Our age is casual, and what we put on the table reflects this 99% of the time. While some own fine bone china and silver patterns, we&#8217;re more likely mixing them with nontraditional items, creating the individualized tables that represent our own style. Even major purveyors of fine china, such Gumps in San Francisco, are creating display tables that mix an assortment of interesting colors, materials, patterns, and ethnic aspects. </p><p>Everyday boxed dinnerware sets often lag behind the rest of the tabletop market. There needs to be more innovation there. Create an affordable line of knock-out dinnerware patterns and you&#8217;ll succeed. </p><p>We give the tabletop market an: <i>AMBER LIGHT </i></p><p>Hopefully this information has given you even more ideas to pursue. Remember, the key to success is innovation. Always be willing to be different. It usually pays off. </p></div><div class="section"><p><i>CHAPTER 6<br/></i></p><p><i>IS YOUR PRODUCT READY <br/>FOR SUCCESS? (A CHECKLIST<br/>TO HELP YOU DECIDE)<br/></i></p></div><p>Across North America and for projects developed by the Department of Commerce, the United Nations, and others, two members of our writing team (Molly Miller-Davidson and JoAnne Stone-Geier ) have traveled for years helping hundreds of new and established entrepreneurs evaluate and tweak their products for the huge American market. We&#8217;ve had the pleasure of discussing a variety of creations with their producers: high-end design and technical products; children&#8217;s toys and furnishings; clothing, fashion accessories and jewelry; furniture and decorative accessories; garden products; cookware and tabletop lines; greeting cards and packaging; personal care items; and especially food and beverage lines (including alcoholic products). One of us was surprised in one market to find herself evaluating a collection of witches&#8217; brews presented by a delightful couple in Canada. We&#8217;ve analyzed new types of toothbrushes, crystal golf clubs, and aromatherapy teddy bears; taste-tested iced wine jams; and even evaluated an ash tray that looked exactly like a healthy pair of lungs (we really liked that concept a lot). </p><p>Throughout our travels, we&#8217;re often asked the same set of questions: &#8220;What do you think of my product?&#8221; (sometimes you really don&#8217;t want to know, but we&#8217;ll try to be tactful), &#8220;What do you think of my packaging?&#8221;, and especially &#8220;What can do I to make this product more successful?&#8221; </p><p>Interestingly enough, most of these questions are not being asked by people who are showing us prototypes (that happens occasionally). Instead, we&#8217;re usually looking at items that have already been in front of buyers for a season or two. Sometimes the producer is doing a fair </p><div class="section"><p><i>65 </i></p><p>amount of business but wants to do better. Other times we can sense the concern already building in the back of someone&#8217;s brain, nagging him with that unspoken question: &#8220;What am I doing <i>wrong</i>?&#8221; </p><p>The underlying question for us is often this: Why are so many intelligent people bringing products into the marketplace <i>before </i>they are truly ready to debut? What&#8217;s the rush? Where&#8217;s the fire? Why aren&#8217;t they taking a few more months&#8212;or even a few more <i>weeks</i>&#8212;to develop a better mousetrap, so to speak? </p><p>Though we never ask these questions aloud, we believe we know part of the answer: People (Americans, in particular) are in such a rush to get their product to market that some of them speed through processes instead of taking the time to stop and analyze each critical step. We can&#8217;t blame producers for wanting to get everything done as quickly as possible. If this is their first product, they are often working without compensation and desperate for the sales to start rolling in to offset all their initial expenses and lack of income. Established product producers are trying to roll out endless new products because the market always demands of them: &#8220;What&#8217;s new?&#8221; In our consumer-driven marketplace that wants to see fresh products two or more times a year, it&#8217;s easy for manufacturers to simply slap new patterns or colors on existing merchandise and say, &#8220;This is new this season . . .&#8221; </p><p>Perhaps you see yourself in one of these two scenarios? </p><p>If you do, take a deep breath, then ask yourself if you might be doing your company long-term damage by rushing a product that isn&#8217;t ready or isn&#8217;t really new to market. It&#8217;s far better to bring a prototype of something that&#8217;s still in development to market (where buyers will happily offer you their opinion) than to bring something that you know isn&#8217;t up to your standards and your company&#8217;s mission statement. Quality counts! </p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="section"><h3><i>SLEEP-WALKING THROUGH PRODUCT PRODUCTION </i></h3><p>Surprisingly, we see a lot of manufacturers and artisans in the marketplace with respectable but lackluster products, and many of them are doing okay. Not great, but somehow they are managing to pay the bills or at least keeping their heads above water. Some of them are even happy with their mid-level &#8220;success,&#8221; having given up the dream of making it big. </p></div><div class="section"><p>But why settle for partial success when you can have much more? </p></div><div class="section"><p>When we lecture about product development, we tell our audi</p></div><p>ences to use certain criteria to judge whether a product should be developed <i>at all</i>. It&#8217;s a simple process of asking yourself a series of questions. We highly suggest that you ask yourself this same list of questions each and every time you develop a new product. If you do, you&#8217;ll end up tossing some &#8220;good&#8221; ideas aside, or perhaps taking an idea and reworking it until it&#8217;s great. Best of all, you&#8217;ll end up having a much clearer idea of your concept and what to do with it. </p><p>Let&#8217;s review those key questions, which you should ask yourself, your partners, and your mentors: </p><p><i>?	What does this product offer the public that they desperately want or need? </i></p><p>If you can&#8217;t think of one thing, your product is already in trouble. If you came up with at least one solid answer, move forward by asking the following set of questions (similar to a few in chapter 1) to help get a clearer idea of why and where your product will fit into the market: </p><table><tr><th/><td><i>? </i></td><td>Is this product something <i>new </i>that a <i>large, clearly defined segment </i>of </td></tr><tr><th/><td/><td>the public won&#8217;t be able to live without? </td></tr><tr><th/><td><i>? </i></td><td>Is this product&#8217;s <i>design unique, </i>or is the market filled with similar-</td></tr><tr><th/><td/><td>looking merchandise? </td></tr><tr><th/><td><i>? </i></td><td>If it&#8217;s not unique, is it <i>lower in price, </i>and will that be an important </td></tr><tr><th/><td/><td>factor? </td></tr><tr><th/><td><i>? </i></td><td>If it&#8217;s neither unique nor lower in price, does it have <i>superior quality </i></td></tr><tr><th/><td/><td>over all its competitors while remaining in their price range? </td></tr><tr><th/><td><i>? </i></td><td>If not any of these, are there <i>enough new features </i>on this product to </td></tr><tr><th/><td/><td>separate it from its competition? </td></tr><tr><th/><td><i>? </i></td><td>If none of these, can I at least <i>make it quicker </i>than my competi</td></tr><tr><th/><td/><td>tion&#8212;and will this matter? (It may, but only if it can replace a cur</td></tr><tr><th/><td/><td>rent popular product that is always hopelessly backordered, and </td></tr><tr><th/><td/><td>this is a <i>rarity</i>. In this case we often suggest that the developer sell </td></tr><tr><th/><td/><td>his production methods and not the product itself.) </td></tr><tr><th/><td><i>? </i></td><td>Does it have <i>longevity, </i>or is it just a flash in the pan? </td></tr><tr><th/><td><i>? </i></td><td>Will this item make an <i>important contribution </i>to my company&#8217;s fu</td></tr><tr><th/><td/><td>ture growth, or is it just another item to stock? </td></tr><tr><th><i>66 </i></th><td/><td/></tr></table><div class="section"><p><i>67 </i></p><p>The bottom line: if this product is not unique, can you make it better, faster, for less, or with more features&#8212;and will that matter to the average consumer and to retailers who may be perfectly happy with your competitor&#8217;s product? If your product can&#8217;t bring an important contribution to the marketplace or to your company, it shouldn&#8217;t be made. <i><sub>Innovation distinguishes</sub></i></p><p>STOP now and either discard the </p><div class="section"><h5><i>between a leader and a</i></h5><p>idea completely or, if you still feel it<br/>has worthwhile potential, keep fine-<i><sup>follower.<br/></sup></i>tuning it for the marketplace and <i>&#8212;STEVEN JOBS / APPLE COMPUTER,<br/></i>don&#8217;t stop until you get some positive <i>INC. &amp; PIXAR ANIMATION STUDIOS<br/></i>responses when you re-ask these same <i>source: Hollywood Reporter<br/></i>critical questions.<br/></p></div></div></div><div class="section"><div class="section"><h3><i>IDENTIFY YOUR CONSUMER BASE </i></h3><p>As you learned in chapter 2, being able to clearly identify your product&#8217;s specific consumer base to retailers is critical. This will be the next step in the process of developing and marketing your product. Remember: no product&#8217;s customer base is &#8220;everybody.&#8221; You can&#8217;t simply go to market and see who buys it. That&#8217;s too risky! Today you must have a clear definition of where your product fits into the market in order to position it. Niche markets rule. Consider this set of questions: </p></div><p><i>?	Does my new item clearly fit into the high-end, middle-end or<br/>low-end market? (Note, the middle-end market is rapidly disap<br/>pearing, so hopefully you picked one of the others. If not, consider<br/>tweaking your product to become a high-end or low-end product.)<br/></i></p><p><i>?	</i>Will my product be <i>purchased </i>more often by men or women?<br/>Young people or older ones? People with conservative tastes or<br/>modern ones?<br/></p><div class="section"><p><i>?	Is my target merchant base for this product independent retailers,<br/>chains, big box stores, restaurants, or car washes and auto supply<br/>shops&#8212;what type of account? (Hopefully you&#8217;ll identify several<br/>specific target retail bases.)<br/></i></p></div><p><i>?	If my customer base is going to be major accounts, am I prepared<br/>for the extra work that will entail at all levels (production, inven<br/>tory, distribution)? <br/></i></p><p><i>?	Will my product require a lot of extras in the marketplace, such as </i></p><p>customer service at the retail level? If so, am I also developing a plan to make that happen and building it into my price? <i>? Will my product have safety issues, and, if so, how are they being addressed at the product development and packaging stages? </i></p><p>Identifying your end purchasers (which may be different than your end consumers, who might be infants, children, or even men who often don&#8217;t do their own shopping) is important in determining your packaging design. Planning for your preferred retail base is critical, too, as packaging concepts vary between markets. </p></div><div class="section"><h3><i>DETERMINE YOUR MARKET&#8217;S SIZE </i></h3><p>Next, determine if your product&#8217;s market is big enough to actually warrant your entry into it, and plan what you will do if it requires extra positioning once you enter the marketplace: </p><p><i>?	</i>Will my product have a <i>sizable </i>customer base? What is it? Sometimes good products are developed for very narrow customer bases. If yours has one, research to find out how big this base really is. For instance, a base of one million <i>potential </i>customers is very different from a base of one million <i>likely </i>customers. If your base is very small, but it&#8217;s apparent that a large number of people within that base will purchase your product out of necessity, it may have a large enough customer count to warrant production. On the other hand, if it&#8217;s an impulse or frivolous purchase, your potential customers within that small base go <i>way down</i>. </p><div class="section"><p>Sometimes good ideas with such small customer bases must be set aside&#8212;unless the product can be tweaked to accommodate more likely end purchasers. </p></div><p><i>?	If my customer base turns out to be broader than I believe it is, have I set aside enough funding to quickly increase my production? Occasionally, there is a big surprise with a parallel market opportunity that will enhance your business if you can go after it. Will you be setting aside enough funding to achieve this? If not, will your initial funding source be able to help you again, or can you seek quick funding elsewhere? Plan ahead! </i></p><p><i>68 </i></p><div class="section"><p><i>69 </i></p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="section"><h3><i>DECIDE ON COLOR AND STYLE </i></h3><p>Next, concentrate on the color and styling of your product: </p></div><p><i>?	Am I familiar with the colors that are just entering the market</i></p><div class="section"><p>place? </p><p><i>?	Will these colors work for my product and my customer base? Will </i></p><p>my end users want the latest fashion colors or not? </p><p><i>?	Should my color selection be based on fads that will require constant change each season, and am I prepared to watch my inventory levels to accomplish that without getting stuck with pass&#233; stock? </i></p></div><p><i>?	Do I need to be conservative in color, or will making a big color splash help set my product apart in an otherwise drab marketplace? </i></p><div class="section"><p>Remember how excited everyone was when Apple<sup>&#174; </sup>brought color to the computer market and when hardware stores started featuring colorful drills and other home improvement products in shades other than traditional metal? Those color changes made our hearts sing! Perhaps your product&#8217;s market is ready for a shakeup, too, and your product will create it. Color is vital to positioning your product. Don&#8217;t just assign colors to your items (a blue, a red, a green). Instead, look at what your competition is doing and consider whether it&#8217;s feasible to do something different. If you choose colors based on fads, not trends, you need to be more careful; yet your customer base may warrant constant color changes. </p><p>To determine colors, you would normally look no further than the latest fashion magazines. However, for products you are still developing, turn to the professionals, those groups that deal with color forecasting as their business. One of the experts we know from this field is Leatrice Eiseman, color consultant and owner of the Eiseman Center for Color Information and Training and director of the Pan-tone Color Institute (the international color group that developed the <i>extremely </i>useful Pantone Color Chart, which is a must-have for all product producers). When we spoke to her about this book, she offered a lot of advice and then suggested we use a popular quote from one of her books to help you understand the urgency and importance of color choice: </p></div><div class="section"><p>Often called the &#8220;silent salesperson,&#8221; color must immediately attract the consumer&#8217;s eye, convey the message of what the product is all about, create a brand identity, and most importantly, help to make the sale. <i>(Pantone Guide to Communicating With Color</i>) </p><p>Are you using your silent salesperson? </p></div><p>We always tell people not to be afraid to use bold colors (especially in your packaging). You may not like neon yellow or apple green, but perhaps they can be a useful tool to set your items apart in some way. If colors are everywhere in your field, but basic black, white, and metal are missing, maybe that&#8217;s the way to go. Consider the entire color range. Do something fresh! </p><p>Eiseman&#8217;s company can be found at colorexpert.com, while Pantone is at pantone.com. There are several other reliable resources in this field as well. Some of them may offer sufficient information online to get you started on the path to understanding color. You can also sign up for free online color trend newsletters as well. But for those of you entering apparel, jewelry, and other high-turn fields, advance notice of color fads and trends will be crucial, and membership to a color forecasting group may be warranted. Other resources include the Color Association of the United States at colorassociation.com, the Color Marketing Group at colormarketing.org, and the Inter-Society Color Council at iscc.org. </p></div><div class="section"><h3><i>DECIDE ON DECORATIVE PACKAGING </i></h3><p>Next, you&#8217;ll want to evaluate your decorative packaging needs. These are the boxes, bags, hangtags/signage, and POP (point of purchase) displays that will be featured with your items or on store shelves: </p><table><tr><th/><td><i>? </i></td><td>Will my item likely be featured on store shelves with or without a </td></tr><tr><th/><td/><td>bag, box, or other outer packaging? This is sometimes determined </td></tr><tr><th/><td/><td>by the type of retailer you will court. Independent retailers show </td></tr><tr><th/><td/><td>most of their goods without boxes, while mass merchants often </td></tr><tr><th/><td/><td>keep things in boxes to simplify restocking shelves. </td></tr><tr><th/><td><i>? </i></td><td>What are my competitors doing, and how can I set my product </td></tr><tr><th/><td/><td>apart from theirs? </td></tr><tr><th/><td><i>? </i></td><td>Will my product actually sit on a shelf, or will it be in a POP dis</td></tr><tr><th/><td/><td>play or hung from a wall system? POPs are often used for small </td></tr><tr><th><i>70 </i></th><td/><td/></tr></table><div class="section"><p><i>71 </i></p><p>items, such as candy, gum, and other impulse items found near cash registers. </p></div><p><i>?	Is my type of product commonly found in stores on a Peg-Board<br/>display where my packaging will require a durable way of attaching<br/>it to a hook system? Kitchen gadgets, hardware accessories, and of<br/>fice supplies are a few examples of items that are often hung on a<br/>Peg-Board or slatwall system and require this.<br/></i></p><p><i>?	If there will be no outside packaging, will my product likely require<br/>a hangtag or other signage to provide extra information? Hangtags<br/>offer you an opportunity to tell customers more about your prod<br/>uct, its quality, production method, dedication to a cause, or simi<br/>lar information. &#8220;Handmade in Oregon&#8221; or &#8220;A portion of our<br/>profits benefits the American Cancer Society&#8221; are two examples of<br/>what might appear on these sales tools. <br/></i></p><p><i>?	Will my product require no extra packaging at all for the market I<br/>will be courting? If so, is my potential marketplace one where at<br/>least an info/price sticker will be necessary to list its price and its<br/>UPC code (see chapters 10 and 13 for more info on UPCs and<br/>RFIDs)?<br/></i></p><div class="section"><p>Next ask: </p></div><p><i>? </i>Will my product require additional or cautionary information that<br/>will go on the packaging or the tag?<br/><i>? </i>Will my product require a full manual or information insert to go<br/>into the box or bag?<br/><i>? </i>Have I left enough room on the packaging, hangtag, or info sticker<br/>for the UPC code and the price?<br/></p><div class="section"><p><i>?	Will printing the information on my packaging in multiple lan<br/>guages increase my sales in the United States? (Note: For some<br/>markets, such as pharmacies and grocery stores, this is appreciated.<br/>For others, especially if you have products that need assembly or<br/>have precautionary notices, it may be required.)<br/></i></p><p>Your product&#8217;s packaging and information should fit the market</p><p>place into which you are headed. Independent retailers have different </p><p>needs than chains. This is your chance to check out your venues and </p></div><div class="section"><p>competitors and do something original. One current trend we like, but </p></div><p>which will likely be over or beyond saturation when you&#8217;re ready to </p><p>plan your packaging is clear, peekaboo boxes. GlaxoSmithKline uses it to set their Aquafresh<sup>&#174; </sup>toothpaste brand apart from the monotonous glut of paper toothpaste packaging styles on grocery and drug store shelves. The see-through packaging really catches the eye. It also says &#8220;fresh&#8221; and &#8220;different,&#8221; which often are translated by customers into &#8220;better.&#8221; At the same time, Aquafresh&#8217;s tube was also overhauled. The company created a unique cap for select items within this brand that has a built-in dental floss supply. The two products are meant for each other, so why not package them together, the company decided. Knowing that some people might run out of toothpaste or floss sooner than the other product, GlaxoSmithKline&#8217;s packaging developers planned ahead with a simple solution: the two items snap apart. Throw one away, keep the other. These decisions brought them a much-deserved packaging award in 2003. </p><p>The bottom line: when you make your color, packaging, and other decisions, don&#8217;t rush through them and do something standard and expected. This is your grand opportunity to set your company and product apart on the shelves of stores everywhere. Make the time to sit down and come up with a different game plan. You&#8217;ll be happy you did. </p><p>There may be packaging suppliers in your community with whom you can work. You may also want to hire a color or packaging expert if your forte is not design. No matter what you ultimately do, don&#8217;t even think about making final decisions until you check out some of the packaging associations&#8217; Web sites to see their thoughts and their latest trends. See the list in our Resource Guide at the back of this book under chapters 6 and 10. </p></div><div class="section"><h3><i>FINAL THOUGHTS </i></h3><p>If this is the first product you are developing and your item is very different from anything in the marketplace, you should consider two more things. </p><p>We often recommend that new designers arrange to do a show-and-tell at a local university&#8217;s marketing class. (Many professors are more than happy to give you five to fifteen minutes of class time because it trains their students.) If your product is for the youth market, you might also arrange to show your item at a local high school to get feedback from your potential audience. Whatever you do, bring your </p><p><i>72 </i><i>73 </i></p><div class="section"><p>product out to the public for their reactions. Ask everyone to be bluntly honest. Often seemingly rude comments such as &#8220;I don&#8217;t know why you did it that way, I&#8217;d do this instead!&#8221; will help you give your product just the right tweak. </p><p>If your product concept passes with flying colors, there is one more important question a new entrepreneur must ask: </p></div><p><i>?	Do I really want to produce this on my own and build a company<br/>around it, knowing that I will also have to keep adding products to<br/>my line to keep it growing?<br/></i></p><div class="section"><p>Some of you may look forward to starting a company of your own. For others, the idea may seem hellish. Luckily, you don&#8217;t have to establish a separate business in order to be successful. If your idea is unlike anything else in the marketplace, you can also consider selling it to someone else who is already in business and collect an up-front fee and royalties, as we discussed in chapter 1. However, you will still have to go through much of the process in this chapter as you develop your theory and prototype. </p><p>Ultimately, you will have to decide how to handle all the product ideas you get. As consultants, we know we can only advise. The final decision is yours. We only hope that you&#8217;ll use our criteria each time you design something new. Don&#8217;t rush&#8212;the path to success is always open! </p></div><div class="section"><p><i>CHAPTER 7<br/></i></p><p><i>TO GIVE OR NOT TO GIVE </i></p></div><p>As consultants, cause marketing (planned charitable giving) has always been something we&#8217;ve championed to manufacturers and artisans during private consultations, as well as in countless magazine articles and in speeches we&#8217;ve given from coast to coast. We believe charitable giving must be considered and planned for from the beginning and that its early benefits outweigh any problems that might arise. </p><p>On the other hand, several of our colleagues point out that a vendor just starting out is usually watching every dollar&#8212;and worrying about more important matters, such as covering payroll and quarterly taxes. &#8220;How can they plan for charitable giving at this juncture?&#8221; many have asked us. We acknowledge and respect their point of view. </p><p>Even one of our mentors got into the debate. &#8220;I often wonder if the money even makes it to some of these causes,&#8221; he said somewhat cynically when we were talking on the phone one day. We must admit, we&#8217;ve wondered the same thing from time to time. </p><p>That said, we still believe that the majority of manufacturers and retailers who endorse a charitable project do follow through&#8212;and with good reason: everyone involved comes out a winner when they do. </p><p>Over the years, we&#8217;ve had the privilege of meeting many manufacturers who have raised thousands of dollars for important causes. Some of them have heart-wrenching reasons for incorporating charitable giving into their new lines. One couple donated through their new greeting card line to fight a childhood disease that took their own child. Another manufacturer planned her new company with her sister, only to lose that sister to cancer shortly after getting her venture off the ground. She then decided to dedicate her new business&#8217;s focus and </p><div class="section"><p><i>75 </i></p><p>a sizable portion of its net income to help researchers find a cure for cancer. Others have contributed some of their profits to create educational opportunities for disadvantaged youth, help battered women get a fresh start, feed the homeless, and vaccinate children in Third World countries. The list of companies that have made firm commitments to charitable causes is extensive. Have all of them lived up to their goals? We&#8217;ll never know. We can only hope most of them have. </p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="section"><h3><i>CHOOSING YOUR CAUSE </i></h3><p>Choose your charity or cause carefully. We suggest as a first step making a list of ten to twenty groups you think you might want to endow. Then find their Web sites to take a closer look at their specific programs. Make certain you find out what percentage of their charitable income is used to run their organization and promote it (as opposed to funding the actual cause). Formulas vary, but we&#8217;ve always heard that an organization should never be using more than 15% of the group&#8217;s total intake to run their office, pay their staff, advertise, and do mass mailings. Yet we know of groups that use a whopping 25% to do this, and others that use as little as 1% to do the same. Generally speaking, large, well-established charities should have lower overhead than smaller ones. </p><p>Once you know more about each group, you can whittle your list down further, based on your newfound knowledge. Look at the income of each group. Perhaps your research found that a group on your list benefited within the past year from an unexpected windfall donation from a single individual or corporate gift. In such cases perhaps you should consider aiding another group, where your funds can clearly make a difference. </p><p>As your list gets smaller, consider your potential customers, both retailers and consumers, and your staff. Are these potential causes ones that many people can relate to, or just a few? If the answer is &#8220;just a few,&#8221; are you certain they&#8217;ll like your choice? Additionally, consider whether any of your potential causes are controversial. If so, they may appeal to you, but be a turnoff to others. Choose carefully, but don&#8217;t settle. If you can&#8217;t make up your mind, keep looking. You&#8217;ll know when the &#8220;fit&#8221; seems right! </p><p>Choosing a cause needn&#8217;t mean a long-term commitment. You </p></div><div class="section"><p>need only endow it for a year before making another choice. However, </p></div></div></div><div class="section"><div class="section"><h3><i>The Longaberger</i><i><sup>&#174; </sup></i><i>Company </i></h3><p><i>Newark, OH/longaberger.com </i></p></div><div class="section"><div class="section"><h5><i>ENCOURAGING EMPLOYEE &#8220;TALKING AND LAUGHING&#8221;<br/>HELPS BUILD A BILLION-DOLLAR COMPANY<br/></i></h5><p>If you&#8217;re one of those entrepreneurs who worry that they lack the skills and drive to grow a company to international prominence, you need look no further than the late Dave Longaberger for inspiration. </p><p>The company Longaberger founded in 1978 is happy to profile his rise from a childhood in which he had three strikes against him (poverty, a severe stutter, and epilepsy, long before it was understood and medical treatments existed). Even as a young child, Longaberger always found an assortment of odd jobs, so many that his family started calling him their &#8220;25-cent millionaire.&#8221; He finally graduated from high school at age 21 and entered the military, then settled down in Dresden, Ohio, upon his return. It was there, in 1963, that Longaberger and his new wife purchased a twelve-seat dairy bar and turned it into a restaurant. Longaberger&#8217;s earlier ambitions returned, and soon he purchased an abandoned food market, remodeled the building, and opened the Dresden IGA Foodliner market. </p><p>In the early 1970s Longaberger noticed that baskets were becoming very popular but that most were imports. Longaberger approached his father, who had been a basket-maker, and asked him to make a few samples for a sales test. The baskets sold briskly, but sadly Longaberger&#8217;s father never lived to see the company established. However, Longaberger was determined to move forward with his vision of a basket factory &#8220;with hun</p></div><p>if you select carefully from the start, chances are you&#8217;ll build a personal relationship that&#8217;s worth nourishing. In fact, we highly recommend that you and your staff also consider a group commitment of time (one day a year or one day a quarter). Giving your time as well as money can keep you grounded on those days when you&#8217;re tired and frustrated. </p><p>One final note on choosing a charity: some manufacturers and artisans choose to benefit more than one group. We find that this seldom works well. Though their intentions are often good, their efforts soon become diluted. They end up standing up for everything and for nothing at the same time. Be brave: make a firm monetary commitment to a single cause and stand by it. </p><p><i>76 </i></p><div class="section"><p>dreds of craftsmen and craftswomen weaving, tacking, talking, and laughing.&#8221; He built such a factory after purchasing a building with sagging floors and broken windows that had been abandoned since 1955. </p><p>Longaberger tried several different ways of selling his company&#8217;s handmade maple baskets, finally settling exclusively on home sales in 1978. Today the Longaberger Company is run by Longaberger&#8217;s daughter Tami, who joined the company in 1984 and was appointed president by her father in 1994. Her sister Rachel runs the family&#8217;s philanthropic arm, the Longaberger Foundation. The company is widely known for their award-winning seven-story picnic basket&#8211;shaped office building in Newark, Ohio, on twenty-five acres of land open to the public for picnics and tours. There and in other U.S. facilities, Longaberger&#8217;s dream of a workplace filled with employees talking and laughing is a huge success. The company now has over 5,400 employees, nearly 70,000 independent home consultants, and over $1 billion in annual sales. </p><p>Tami Longaberger, who worked side-by-side with her father until his death in 1999, has diversified the company to include tabletop, wrought iron, home accessories, and foods. The new divisions now account for almost half the company&#8217;s business. The Longaberger Company is recognized as one of the largest woman-owned and -operated companies in the United States, thanks to Tami&#8217;s keen business insights and the vision of her father, who defied the odds and built a basket empire. </p><p>(To learn more about Dave Longaberger&#8217;s vision, read his autobiography, <i>Longaberger: An American Success Story, </i>published by HarperCollins.) </p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="section"><h3><i>GIVING DOESN&#8217;T HAVE TO HURT </i></h3><p>You may already be siding with our colleagues, saying to yourselves: &#8220;We can&#8217;t handle this now.&#8221; Yet establishing a charitable endowment doesn&#8217;t have to mean giving until it hurts. There are many ways to make it painless from the start. Here are some of them: </p><p><i>Line-wide giving </i>is the most challenging. It means giving a part of your gross or net profits on your entire line to a charity of your choosing. If you&#8217;re a young company choosing this route, we recommend giving based on net sales. If you want to be more generous when you&#8217;re newly successful, <i>great</i>! But start small and build from there. Sit down </p></div><p>with your accountant and discuss what percentage of giving will work </p><p>for your company without impeding your regular business efforts. This varies from company to company, simply because some products and lines have much higher profit margins than others. Ultimately, you need to establish a firm plan: will you choose a modest 1 to 2% to start; a mid-range 5 to 10%; or are you so committed to a cause that you&#8217;ll give even more and make your venture as much about giving as receiving? Frankly, <i>it doesn&#8217;t matter. </i>It&#8217;s the giving and the long-term commitment to giving that count. </p><p>If you&#8217;ve dedicated your entire line to a good cause, make sure people know. Line-wide giving is usually noted on each product&#8217;s packaging or hangtags to alert potential customers of your contribution. &#8220;A percentage of sales from our line supports the efforts of the Alzheimer&#8217;s Foundation&#8221; or &#8220;Our sales support the International Red Cross&#8221; explains it well. Sometimes it might even sway a consumer&#8217;s or a retailer&#8217;s decision in favor of your line. In fact, several reports have noted that consumers from Gen Y (and younger) are particularly partial to cause marketing. </p><p>When you introduce your new line to the press in a news release (covered in chapter 14), it will also be important to tell them about your decision to benefit others. This is a feel-good angle that many trade and local publications will want to bring to the attention of their readers. </p><p>If line-wide giving seems too extreme for your company, or if you prefer to work up to that level of commitment, there are many other ways to aid worthy causes. Consider giving through a <i>single product promotion </i>instead of across your entire line. We&#8217;ve seen manufacturers successfully promote a bracelet, a candy bar, or a stationery set to benefit a cause. In these cases the item is new to their line and sometimes even incorporates a symbol of the cause in the product (such as a pink ribbon for breast cancer research or an endangered bird for an ecology program). Sometimes the manufacturer or artisan will donate all profits from that product to the cause; other times only a percentage is given (though usually not less than 25%). </p><p>When a single product promotion is initiated, send a news release to trade editors and to the editors of any pertinent cause publications, along with a photo of the product. Include specific information about the term of the donation (often one year or ongoing) and the percentage that your company is giving. </p><div class="section"><p>If both of these charitable options seem too difficult initially, you </p></div><p><i>78 </i><i>79 </i></p><div class="section"><p>can always aid various charities and causes through the <i>donation of products </i>from your line. Many of these opportunities will be in your own community, so keep your eyes and ears open. Perhaps your school system is having a silent auction to fund arts or sports programs. Check with your local symphony, ballet, or art museum to find out if they are having fund-raisers involving product giveaways. The opportunities to serve your community exist; you just have to find them. </p><p>If you have appropriate products for these and similar regional causes, this may be your opportunity to establish some enduring ties right in your community. We highly encourage at least some level of commitment to your town or region. Your company will benefit from the recognition and respect you get in return. </p><p>One final means of charitable involvement isn&#8217;t about giving at all. In many communities across the country, there are opportunities for manufacturers and artisans to use outside shipping and mass mailing services that hire and train mentally challenged individuals to provide their services. Many of our clients have used these companies for years and find their employees to be exceptional in their work. </p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="section"><h3><i>SOME EXCELLENT INDUSTRY CHARITIES TO CONSIDER </i></h3><p>As we have mentioned, there are many worthy groups from which to choose. If you don&#8217;t have one in mind, you may want to consider aligning your charitable efforts with those of an industry organization to which you belong (see chapter 8 and the Resource Guide for contacts). </p><p>There are also charities that have sprung up within the past twenty years that now span several industries and have raised millions of dollars for worthy causes. Here are three notable ones (in alphabetical order): </p></div><div class="section"><div class="section"><h5><i>Design Industries Foundation Fighting AIDS (DIFFA) </i></h5><p>DIFFA was established in 1984, near the beginning of the AIDS epidemic, when it became apparent that the design industries were going to loose many of their members to this immune disorder. Over twenty years later, they&#8217;re one of the largest funders for HIV/AIDS education and service programs in the United States. During that time, they&#8217;ve raised more than $30 million through events that include their now fa</p></div><div class="section"><p>mous Dining by Design, an event cosponsored by <i>Elle D&#233;cor </i>magazine. </p></div><p>Though DIFFA members come from all fields, the majority are from </p><p>the home furnishing, architectural, and fashion industries. You can find them at diffa.org and at (212) 727-3100. </p></div><div class="section"><h5><i>Gift for Life (GFL) </i></h5><p>Established in 1992, GFL was also founded to address the tragic loss of talented members of various industries to AIDS&#8212;in this case primarily the gift, stationery, home decor, and fashion accessory industries. Their focus is different from DIFFA in that they support medical research, prevention, and treatment education programs in cooperation with the American Foundation for AIDS Research (amfAR). As GFL members point out, amfAR&#8217;s widely respected research has also benefited people with cancer and other major diseases, thus spreading the goodwill of their group. GFL has raised millions of dollars through events, including Samples Off Fifth, a preholiday gift sale in New York City of items donated by manufacturers and artisans. Additionally, money has been raised by the sale of specific products donated by their members and by the in-house efforts of retailers. GFL can be reached at giftforlife.org and at (212) 805-1600. </p></div><div class="section"><h5><i>Gifts in Kind International (GIK) </i></h5><p>This organization was started by 3M in 1983 and has quickly grown to become one of the largest charities in the United States. It now spans many high-tech and nontech industries, with manufacturer and retailer members donate products that are matched with over 200,000 charitable organizations around the world that choose the products they need from the GIK wish list. In 2002 GIK retailers and manufacturers donated nearly $800 million in products to charities around the globe. While many of their donor members are huge corporations, there is room for donations by smaller companies, too. They can be contacted at giftsinkind.org and at (703) 836-2121. </p></div></div><div class="section"><h3><i>ADDITIONAL BENEFITS </i></h3><p>Keep track of all your product and monetary contributions and make certain your accountant takes all the appropriate deductions at year&#8217;s end. Then look at the amount and determine if you are satisfied with </p><p><i>80 </i><i>81 </i></p><div class="section"><p>your company&#8217;s level of commitment. Perhaps it&#8217;s too low, or it may actually be too high. Make the proper adjustments before you enter the next fiscal year. </p><p>When you hand over that first check at the end of the year, consider doing it with some fanfare. Don&#8217;t be shy: retailers and consumers (and even our cynical mentor) will enjoy knowing you made a commitment and followed through. If your company is donating a particularly large amount to a group, have an oversized check made to hand to your cause&#8217;s representative during a photo op. Then send copies with a news release to the appropriate media. Consider also posting news about your company&#8217;s commitment and the amount contributed on your Web site. </p><p>Knowing that your company has made a difference to an important cause is a great feeling, representing a whole new level of success! </p></div><div class="section"><div class="section"><h4><i>CHAPTER 8<br/></i></h4><p><i>THE POWER OF NETWORKING (AND WHERE TO DO IT) </i></p></div><p>Developing a new product and finding the right markets for it can be a lonely job! </p><p>Whether you&#8217;re starting a brand-new company, changing the direction of an existing company, or adding a new product category, you may find yourself feeling very isolated at times. The good news is that networking can help a lot. </p><p>Most of you already understand the concept, which is described by our friend Mr. Webster as &#8220;making connections with people or groups of a like kind.&#8221; That sounds straightforward enough. Yet many people either fail to understand the many benefits of networking or go about it the wrong way. </p><div class="section"><p>So, there&#8217;s a <i>wrong </i>way? </p></div><p>Absolutely! We see people doing it all the time&#8212;and you probably have, too. We described it as overzealous networking. You know the type: businesspeople who believe that everybody they meet is a networking opportunity. They hand out their business cards to <i>everyone, everywhere. </i>They&#8217;re the irritating person circulating the room at cocktail parties and the person you&#8217;d least like to sit next to at a ball game. They&#8217;re always in business mode. Worst of all, they make hundreds of superficial connections they&#8217;ll never need! </p><p>On the other hand, those who network well understand what they are trying to accomplish, plus when and where to do it. </p><p>It&#8217;s quite simple, really. There are opportunities all around you, but not all are alike. Some offer solid business or legal connections, others are great if you need help with product development, some can help you zoom in on marketing and sales. You don&#8217;t need all of these con</p><div class="section"><p><i>83 </i></p><p>nections at once, but it&#8217;s good to know that they exist when you&#8217;re ready to use them. Some will be helpful for a month, others for a year, and some for the lifetime of your business. Some are free of charge, and others can cost money but may be worth every penny you spend. The trick is understanding your options and what each can do for you. </p></div></div></div><div class="section"><div class="section"><h3><i>MONEY-SAVING TIP </i></h3><p>We thoroughly researched many of the Web sites in this chapter and the Resource Guide that we are proposing you evaluate for your own business use. </p><p>Good news: there are some excellent resources that offer a great deal of help on their Web sites. It might not be necessary to join those groups. Consider adding them to your computer&#8217;s favorites list until you determine your needs. Other Web sites offer important additional benefits beyond what is featured online, such as members-only chat portals, in-house publications, and in-person educational venues. Consider joining those or ask about a trial membership. </p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="section"><h3><i>EARLIEST-STAGE NETWORKING HELP </i></h3><p>The Small Business Administration (sba.gov), covered in chapter 1, is a great tool, offering everything a new company needs to get started, including up-to-date information on business laws, regulatory assistance, and a start-up business kit. They offer both in-person and online help. Check out the opportunities to connect with others through their Small Business Training Network (for everyone) and through select portals for women and minority business owners. Many of their resources are free of charge. </p><p>For regional connections, check out your state&#8217;s official Web site and enter their business portal (usually found on the left-hand menu). You&#8217;ll find numerous opportunities to network with other businesspeople in your state. You can access most state sites this way: www.state [your state&#8217;s two-letter abbreviation].us. </p><p>On a local level, check out your regional Chamber of Commerce&#8217;s Web site to see what it offers. These groups vary greatly. Some offer excellent resources and networking connections for young businesses, such as economic and workforce development, regional economic </p></div><p>forecasts and trends, small business development classes, and even divi</p><p>sions dedicated to women in business. Others are truly disappointing, serving more of a social function within their community than a true business one. </p></div><div class="section"><h3><i>THE MANY PERKS OF ASSOCIATION MEMBERSHIP </i></h3><p>At all stages of your business, there likely is no better friend to a product producer than an association in your field. There are several types. Those specializing in manufacturing or even specific materials used in manufacturing (plastic or wood, for instance) are very popular. Others that specialize in wholesaling, importing, or retailing can be of excellent assistance later, when your company is ready to start its marketing campaign. </p><p>There are over 35,000 trade associations just waiting to help your company succeed. The problem sometimes is trying to find the right one! But don&#8217;t worry. For your convenience we&#8217;ve honed the list down to around 150 groups. Our abbreviated list (found in the Resource Guide) is diverse enough that we envision almost everyone who reads this book finding several suitable options. As you use the Resource Guide, note the founding date of each group. While a new group may be excellent, one with a long history will assure you of the group&#8217;s success. </p><p>If you&#8217;re willing to jump in and really participate, you&#8217;ll find many good reasons for joining an association&#8212;and most of them help spell <i>success</i>. </p><div class="section"><p>Here are some important points about these groups: </p></div><ul><li>Many associations have been around for decades (some a century or more). With that kind of history and industry background, they&#8217;re like graduate school&#8212;especially for beginners. Use the &#8220;about us&#8221; portal on Web sites to find out more. </li><li>Members can easily get input from other members. Trade associations and their members can help you troubleshoot a machinery problem and keep you up-to-date about technology, raw materials, and suppliers pertinent to your business. </li><li>Associations will keep you on top of your industry&#8217;s latest trends and award winners. Knowing what is cutting edge in your industry </li></ul><p><i>84 </i><i>85 </i></p><div class="section"><p>can keep your line looking fresh instead of like yesterday&#8217;s news. At the same time, if you see too many other members using the same packaging or raw material, you can also use this information to differentiate your company&#8217;s line from the rest. Start your own trend, and maybe next year you&#8217;ll be in line for one of those product awards! </p><ul><li>Some associations produce excellent <i>trade shows </i>in which you can participate, meet potential customers, review other products, and interact with others who share your specific interests, concerns, and dreams. </li><li>Association <i>technical shows </i>are where machinery and raw material suppliers show their wares to you. </li><li>Most associations are active lobbyists for your field in Washington and will keep you informed about legal and regulatory changes that may impact your business. For instance, some industries worry that China&#8217;s debut into the world market will greatly affect U.S. manufacturers&#8217; ability to compete, so they lobby for controls. Other industries are worried about how the government will redefine labels like &#8220;organic,&#8221; &#8220;low carb,&#8221; and &#8220;low fat.&#8221; If these are concerns for your company, wouldn&#8217;t you want someone in Washington looking out for you to make certain the playing field is as level as possible? </li><li>Many associations offer insurance and other health plans to their members at discounts. This is especially important for new company owners on a budget who might otherwise be tempted to forego insurance the first year or two (never a smart idea!). </li><li>Almost all associations&#8217; Web sites are updated daily or weekly. (For instance, in 2004 the mad cow scare in the United States was instantly covered online by pertinent food organizations to help their members determine what they needed to do to safeguard their products and reassure their customers.) </li><li>Several Web sites offer chat rooms where you can ask a specific question and get answers from several other members who likely have more experience than you do. </li><li>Many associations (especially those in the food and beverage industries) have codes of ethics, ensuring that their members all meet high standards. Some offer seals of approval that can be featured on your packaging. This perk is only available to companies that sub</li></ul></div><div class="section"><p>mit their product (and often open their manufacturing facility) to </p><p>thorough inspections. </p></div><p>&#10065;	Quite a few associations also post their membership contact lists online. Since many association Web sites have both manufacturer and consumer portals, this can help potential customers find your company more easily. It can also help you find others in your area with whom to network. </p></div><div class="section"><h3><i>OTHER OPPORTUNITIES </i></h3><p>Once your line is up and going, you&#8217;ll also find many opportunities to connect with fellow manufacturers (or artisans) at other important events, including nonassociation trade shows throughout the United States. You&#8217;ll find out more about these show producers in chapter 15, Important Trade Shows and Permanent Showroom Buildings, and in our Resource Guide. </p><div class="section"><p>So, ask yourself: </p></div><ul><li>Do you really want to try to go it alone when it&#8217;s doubtful you could make a better connection anywhere than through networking? </li><li>Why let your competition have the insider&#8217;s track when you can have it, too? </li></ul><p>Even when membership is necessary and costly, hooking up with the right networking opportunities can be worth their weight in gold. </p><p><i>86<br/></i></p><div class="section"><p><i>CHAPTER 9 </i></p><p><i>FIRST ROUND AND BEYOND </i></p><p>Here in Hollywood, it&#8217;s not uncommon to watch our neighbors seek funding to make their pet projects, usually new films or television pilots. Show business is a very volatile field where it&#8217;s often a sink-orswim situation. One neighbor may make that television pilot, never to see it picked up by one of the networks or cable channels. Another may start making her film only to run over budget and out of cash. Or worse yet, finish it only to see her big project sit on a shelf with no one interested in distributing it. </p><p>On the flip side, some finish projects within budget, watch them get picked up for wide distribution, and find themselves swimming in money less than a year later. Because the rewards&#8212;if they come&#8212;can be huge, many here in Tinseltown take equally huge chances, often maxing out their credit cards on the slim chance that they&#8217;ll make it into the big time. If they do, it&#8217;s not uncommon to see them get an automatic green light for their next big project. After all, they delivered once. Certainly they can do it again, right? </p><p>Wait a minute . . . this is starting to sound like <i>our </i>industries! And indeed the scenarios are often the same. However, we never recommend that you max out your credit cards to finance new products. There are other ways to secure the funding that are more reliable and won&#8217;t sink you if your product goes down in flames. </p><p>Obviously the first step, prior to even considering your financial options, is to come up with your product&#8217;s game plan, which we helped you create in chapter 6. Perhaps that chapter helped you decide to sell your idea to an existing company and simply sit back and collect the royalties. If you decided to continue on your own, you&#8217;re now ready to </p></div><p>move on through the next steps. To make that happen, you need to se</p><p>cure funding. Yet the idea of borrowing a great deal of money is often a scary proposition for product designers or for young companies hoping to expand their businesses. </p><p>Now that you have a clearer vision of what you want to do, after evaluating your product&#8217;s customer bases, market share, design, and packaging, it&#8217;s time for you to write your <i>business plan </i>(also called a <i>business and marketing plan</i>), which will serve as your company&#8217;s resume. It&#8217;s based on all the information you&#8217;ve been collecting and the decisions you&#8217;ve made while reading the previous chapters. Your business plan will be a crucial part of your presentation to potential investors, your bank, or if you decide to seek a grant (see chapter 1 for more info on grants). </p><p>We suggest that you write the first draft of your business plan&#8212;or at least get the basic info and statistics in order. If you feel comfortable with your presentation, <i>great</i>! If not, we highly recommend that you hire a professional writer who is familiar with business plans to fine-tune it. Your accountant may also be of help in organizing your <i>financial projections</i>. Within your business plan, you will need to show your growth and outlay projections over a period of time (usually based on one-year, two-year, and five-year periods). The marketing aspects are more difficult to project at the beginning of your project. If you&#8217;d prefer, you can create a separate presentation on that once you have completed reading this book. However, having a handle on both areas prior to meeting with your potential financiers is best. </p><p>Don&#8217;t let this task seem daunting, if you&#8217;re not a &#8220;numbers person.&#8221; There are several sources that can help you get started. The U.S. Small Business Administration (sba.gov) offers Business Plan Basics, an excellent blueprint for building your business. Money Hunt (money hunter.com) offers a downloadable business plan template you can follow, based on the PBS show, <i>Money Hunt, </i>and on Miles Spencer and Cliff Ennis&#8217;s book, <i>Moneyhunt: 27 New Rules for Creating and Growing a Breakaway Business. </i>StartUPbiz.com is an excellent resource for generic materials on both the financial and marketing aspects of business. They offer workbooks for sale on both areas. </p><p>So, what do investors look for when deciding whether to take a gamble with a company? </p><p>Since this is not our area of expertise, we went right to the money sources and asked. Hopefully this information will help you decide where to seek your first, second, and third round of funding. </p><p><i>88 </i><i>89 </i></p></div><div class="section"><div class="section"><h3><i>ANDREA OPPENHEIM&#8217;S ADVICE </i></h3><p>Our first visit was with Andrea Ellis Oppenheim, the president of OCG Financial, LLC, in Deerfield, Illinois, to talk about <i>initial funding</i>. Her company specializes in one of the areas we will be discussing, but she was kind enough to give us an overview of the major funding sources that product developers should consider. </p><p>Surprisingly, <i>banks </i>are usually not your best first stops when seeking initial funding, according to Oppenheim. Most banks are leery of giving loans to start-ups. Unless you have a long-term relationship with their organization, have had several years of other business success, and your company looks very stable, banks will most likely turn you away. They&#8217;re simply not in the business of helping young companies get a foot up into the marketplace! </p><p>Instead, Oppenheim suggests that brand-new product producers or very young companies (under five years old) consider seeking funding in one of the five ways discussed below. </p><p>Though you may be reluctant to do it, consider the <i>F&amp;F </i>route for small amounts of money: that&#8217;s friends and family&#8212;the people most likely to believe in what you&#8217;re doing and to be willing to fork over start-up money with few questions. The problem with this avenue, notes Oppenheim, is that often product producers don&#8217;t anticipate their monetary needs and run out of money prior to launch time. What do you do when you&#8217;ve already asked&#8212;ask again? </p><p>An additional problem: friends and family are often the last people many product producers pay back, sometimes leading to ill will. Consider this route if you want or need to, but proceed with caution if you venture there. And, as Oppenheim emphasized several times during our talk, put your agreement with these loved ones in writing and make certain your attorney looks at the contract before everyone signs it. You&#8217;ll want to specify therein that you will repay these people with interest (or with a percentage of your company). Having an agreement in black and white may put a little more pressure on you, but it will prevent hard feelings and misunderstandings in the long run. </p><p>Another type of money source Oppenheim mentioned is <i>angel funding</i>. Often applied to Broadway productions, angel funding is a type of funding that is available to product producers, too. Angel funding means that the &#8220;angel&#8221; does not take out an equity (ownership) stake in your company, generally sets no specific time limit on when </p></div><p>you pay him back, doesn&#8217;t ask for a management position in your com</p><p>pany or on your board, and basically has a &#8220;no set rules&#8221; policy. He&#8217;s giving you funding because he believes in what you&#8217;re doing and thinks you&#8217;ll succeed. </p><p>Angel funding can come from an individual or a group and can go to you individually or to your company. They will allow you to make a presentation (sometimes for a fee) to see if any of their members will be interested in your project. Occasionally, an angel will give money outright (as a gift) with no strings attached. However, they&#8217;re more likely to require payback once your company is firmly established, sometimes without interest. In many cases, depending on the contract, if your product (and company) fail and go into bankruptcy, they do not recover their investment. </p><p>The down side: angels are often very difficult to find, so don&#8217;t get your hopes too high. Consider this option a long shot, if you want to pursue it. </p><p>Another category similar to angel funding is <i>grant </i>money. If you&#8217;re developing a product that fills a specific need, you may qualify for one. The advantage to grant funding is that there is usually no payback. The money is yours, period. </p><p>However, unlike angel funding, you&#8217;ll have tons of paperwork to fill out just to apply for a grant. Additionally, many committees granting funds meet only a few times each year, so the waiting period can throw off your development and marketing plans. And often the money isn&#8217;t a large sum. </p><p>To find out more about grants, start at grants.gov. (This is a U.S. government site for American companies only.) There are several good commercial sites, too, though be aware that some of them are online simply to try to sell you their book or seminar on grant funding. </p><p>Venture capital was the fourth form of money supply for companies that Oppenheim mentioned. (We&#8217;ll visit a venture capitalist later in the chapter.) </p><p>Last, but not least, Oppenheim introduced us to another option for start-ups and young companies that might work well for many of you. It is actually her company&#8217;s area of business, called <i>factoring</i>. Some of you may be familiar with this term if you have been involved in the rag industry (garment business), where it has been used for years. </p><p>Here&#8217;s how it works: technically, in factoring the company you approach is arranging for individuals or other businesses to buy your invoices. They&#8217;re acting as your broker. Say, for instance, that you&#8217;ve </p><p><i>90 </i><i>91 </i></p><div class="section"><p>exhibited at a trade show using a prototype of your new product and you&#8217;ve managed to secure some very big orders. You can then go to a factoring agent and they will &#8220;buy&#8221; your invoice. This, in turn, will give you a limited amount of time (perhaps 90 to 120 days) to produce your item, ship your goods to retailers, and get paid by your new accounts. Since the factor company owns your invoice, they get paid and then pay you. </p><p>This process is especially good for companies that need to expand quickly to meet new, <i>documented </i>demand. The factor agent will want to see signed orders, not simply letters of intent from retailers. You can use the funding to purchase raw materials and even use it to buy or lease machinery, if necessary. Factoring involves an up-front processing fee plus usually either a flat fee at the end, a percentage, or both. </p><p>According to Oppenheim, factoring is attractive to both product developers and to individuals looking to make investments, since there are already orders for the product in place. She told us that many Americans are investing in factoring projects instead of (or in addition to) buying CDs or investing in the stock market. Factoring provides security and a high yield that many other investments can&#8217;t offer, which means that there likely will be more factoring money available in the future. </p><p>Oppenheim agrees with us wholeheartedly about being able to sum up what you do in just a few short sentences. &#8220;You need to be able to explain your business and your business plan in five minutes,&#8221; she said. &#8220;If I can&#8217;t understand your business, I don&#8217;t want to do the funding.&#8221; </p><p>However, she notes that when she and others in this field like what they see, they&#8217;re more than willing to help you develop your presentation for investors, fill out the necessary applications, and find investors for you. It can be a win-win situation! </p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="section"><h3><i>STEVE KING&#8217;S ADVICE </i></h3><p>Our next interview was with Steve King, principle of Prairie Capital Venture in Chicago, a company that works with a lot of consumer product companies, a category that he claims is very appealing to venture capitalists (VCs). </p><p>King talked to us about three levels of funding. He agrees with Oppenheim that bank funding should not be sought for start-ups and young companies; noting that while banks may be the least costly </p></div><div class="section"><p>means of funding, they&#8217;re also the most restrictive and least patient </p></div></div></div><div class="section"><div class="section"><h3><i>Three Dog Bakery </i></h3><p><i>Kansas City, MO/3dogbakery.com </i></p></div><div class="section"><div class="section"><h5><i>SEEKING SUCCESS, THIS COMPANY NATURALLY <br/>WENT TO THE DOGS<br/></i></h5><p>When we finally caught up with Three Dog Bakery owners Dan Dye and Mark Beckloff, they were in New York filming a segment for the <i>Discovery Channel </i>on the success of their sixteen-year-old company. </p><p>Like many entrepreneurs, Beckloff (an accountant) and Dye (a copywriter) started their company based on a personal need. One of their three dogs was sickly, skeletal, and simply refused to eat. On their veterinarian&#8217;s advice, they started cooking for her, following strict ingredient guidelines. It worked, and soon their friends started coming to them for the unique dog biscuits they developed in the process. They soon set up a kitchen in their basement for their growing project. Eventually, they brought their wrapped treats to their vet and a local pet store, where the owners reluctantly agreed to stock a few packages. The following week each called for twenty-four more packs. The men soon sought out sales in gift shops, pet stores, and even food stores, lining up between fifty and sixty accounts before moving their business to a nearby warehouse. There, a large sign announced, &#8220;freshly baked, all natural dog biscuits.&#8221; While their original concept was wholesale only, they added a small retail outlet to the bakery, due to demand. </p></div><p>when it comes to repayments. That&#8217;s why he classifies bank funding as <i>senior funding</i>, to be used primarily by older, well-established companies with long histories of success. </p><p>Another level of securing money is called <i>alternative </i>or <i>mezzanine funding</i>. This is a hybrid debt instrument that provides a lot of options for both parties. It can be structured to fit your needs and the lender&#8217;s risks for either a short or long period of time. </p><p>Mezzanine funding could involve a combination of partial debt and partial ownership as a way for the funder to be paid. (In other cases factoring could be used to buy all of your invoices for a year to help you through a growth period.) This type of funding is considered the middle ground of securing money that falls between banks (very tight with funding) and venture capitalists (more open). </p><div class="section"><p><i>Venture capital </i>funding is also called equity funding. This is the </p></div><p><i>92 </i></p><div class="section"><p>Accountant Beckloff has made certain their expansion has been careful and focused. Today the company has over twenty bakeries in the United States and nine international locations. Their product line has expanded to include healthy entrees, celebration cakes, and even a twelve-month &#8220;Lucky Dog&#8221; club that delivers natural treats once a month. </p><p>The pair have many celebrity clients and have appeared on the cover of <i>Forbes</i>. Their advice for you: (1) &#8220;Always invite the customer into the experience . . . The aroma from the bakery in the store is for both the humans and the pets.&#8221; (2) &#8220;Capture the customer&#8217;s imagination for even a few moments and you&#8217;ll have created the seed of a buzz, which is the best PR for a business.&#8221; (3) &#8220;When things go up or down, always remember the first nugget of passion.&#8221; </p><p>Their business philosophy includes trying to always say &#8220;yes.&#8221; For instance, they said yes to shipping, then figured out the logistics. Today their treats are shipped to consumers and to retailers, who stock their packaged bags and tins filled with products that make pets and their owners happy. In fact, their sister was the first to spot their success potential when she noticed that customers entered and left their first two shops with smiles on their faces. Their Web site reinforces the fun. Instead of the regular menu options, theirs are titled &#8220;company &#8216;paw&#8217;ticulars,&#8221; &#8220;sniff out a store,&#8221; &#8220;shopping basset,&#8221; and our favorite, &#8220;bark back.&#8221; </p><p>As the Web site indicates, Dye and Beckloff have a &#8220;paw&#8221;sion for canines, and in their case it&#8217;s <i>naturally </i>led to success. </p></div><div class="section"><p>most costly for a product producer to do in the long run, as it entails giving away a percentage of your company&#8217;s ownership and part of your overall control to the venture capital firm. A venture capitalist also often acts as an advisor and has a seat on your board of directors. They are very &#8220;hands on,&#8221; which may be a turn-off for some product developers and a joy for others. </p><p>However, beyond giving away so much, working with a venture capitalist is often the least restrictive way to secure funding. Another plus: venture capital relationships are often long term. They&#8217;ll be there for you through the difficult growth periods and there to celebrate with you when your company succeeds, which usually means when it goes public with an initial public offering (IPO) on the stock exchange. At that point, most venture capitalists sell out and you&#8217;re on your own with a much larger company and stockholders to please. </p></div><div class="section"><p>&#8220;We look to back good people with stable companies,&#8221; King noted </p></div><p>while describing the type of companies his venture firm supplies with capital. &#8220;We invest in companies with steady growth,&#8221; he added. </p><p>This is a much different picture of venture capital than we had in the late 1990s when it seemed that venture capitalists were throwing money at young dot.com companies and related start-ups. Those days are long gone. Today, according to King, the companies that should be seeking venture capital are seldom young. Instead, most venture capital seekers are companies looking for a monetary infusion that will either fuel anticipated growth (based on solid projections) or affect ownership change (bringing their company to an IPO level). In fact, according to King, most of the companies securing venture capital nowadays have been in business at least five years, have a positive cash flow, and over $5 million in revenue. &#8220;Today&#8217;s venture capitalist is looking for a low-risk venture,&#8221; King explained. </p><p>If you think you can qualify, here is what King told us venture capital companies look for in your proposal and presentation: start by showing good marketing research and a solid understanding of the needs of the consumer in relation to your product. Have a very good sense of the cost of production. Be able to explain your company&#8217;s resources and your retail distribution channels. </p></div><div class="section"><h3><i>BILL SNOW&#8217;S ADVICE </i></h3><p>For additional information on funding, we turned to the informative and witty Web site Billsnow.com to review <i>Venture Capital 101 </i>by Bill Snow. We found that Snow provides solid information that can be applied to all types of fund seeking. </p><p>Snow offers sharp advice for people making funding presentations. Among other points, he stresses that fund seekers should answer all questions honestly, directly, and accurately. </p><p>They should also offer funders a compelling reason to invest, present a list of competitors (noting that <i>everyone </i>has some competitors), and be very polite. He explains that it pays to understand the venture capital world&#8217;s special lingo and to avoid using terms such as &#8220;the greatest product in the world.&#8221; </p><p>Snow notes that during an initial presentation, venture capitalists (and many other money lenders) are looking for reasons to <i>eliminate </i>candidates, not fund them&#8212;that will come later. During the initial </p><p><i>94 </i><i>95 </i></p><div class="section"><p>process, don&#8217;t be too impressed or too hopeful if they use positive words in describing your presentation or product. These people tend to be very polite, claims Snow. Many of them are looking at fifty, a hundred, or even a thousand presentations a month, many by people who are using those same tired words, &#8220;the greatest.&#8221; </p><p>Finally, Snow notes that people shouldn&#8217;t be offended when they are turned down by a venture capitalist (or other money source). &#8220;Just because VCs reject your company does not mean your company is a &#8216;bad&#8217; company. It just means it doesn&#8217;t fit within the very narrow requirements of the VC industry,&#8221; Snow offers. </p><p>We want to note that this chapter is by no means meant to be more than an introduction to the types of funding that are available. Hopefully, some of these options appeal to you. If so, you&#8217;ll want to do more research and then contact professionals within those fields. </p><p>We realize that funding a company is not an easy task. It&#8217;ll take a lot of work to put your presentation together and start (proverbially) knocking on doors. However, the right funding can make the difference between small and big growth. Chances are, you can&#8217;t build a strong company without it. </p></div><p><i>CHAPTER 10<br/></i></p><div class="section"><div class="section"><h4><i>HANDLING ALL THE PAPERWORK </i></h4></div><p>If you&#8217;re like most of us, you don&#8217;t enjoy doing paperwork, yet you also realize that somehow it all needs to be done&#8212;and done properly&#8212;to keep the wheels of commerce turning. This chapter will address the first two types of paperwork you must handle to get your product up and going, not the tedious kind you and your staff will be doing on an ongoing basis. (You&#8217;re on your own with that!) </p><p>We&#8217;re going to break this chapter into two parts, as some of you may not need Part 1 about the paperwork for establishing your own company. In that case move on to Part 2, which may be of interest to you if you need ideas for effective logos, brochures, and other product paperwork. If you are a fairly well-established company looking only for fresh product development and marketing ideas in this book, you can skip this chapter. </p><p><i>PART 1: MAKING THINGS &#8220;OFFICIAL&#8221; </i></p><p><i>(Author&#8217;s note: Also see chapter 1) </i></p><p>If you&#8217;re not already in business when you decide to launch your new product, you&#8217;ll need to form one. Your first step is for all parties (if you&#8217;ll have general or limited business partners) to write a short letter of intent to submit during several of the next steps. It should simply outline the type of business you are establishing (a manufacturing or design partnership, for instance) and list your name as sole proprietor or the names and percentages all partners will have in this business. It </p><div class="section"><p><i>97 </i></p><p>can also list a tentative name for your company, if you have one, while noting clearly that this is not yet your business&#8217;s legal name. </p><p>At this point, you&#8217;ll also want to outline the start of your business plan, if you didn&#8217;t do that already. Keep it simple, but outline what your expectations are for years one, two, and five. </p><p>Your next step is to establish a company name and tag lines, those few words that will appear with your company name to help people hone in on what you do (example: ANGELA&#8217;S PASTA: A Taste of Heaven Right Here on Earth). Choosing a legal name isn&#8217;t as easy as it seems. You may like a name, but it may already be taken by a company with a product or service too similar to yours. In that case you&#8217;ll be turned down to avoid confusing the public and the government. Therefore, unless it&#8217;s fairly obvious that your company or product name will not already be out there, we suggest you start by compiling a list of at least five names you find acceptable. </p><p>Next, run this list by several friends and others you respect to get their input. Ask them to rate their top two or three choices and also to tell you why they like or dislike particular names on your list. Some of these people may have an unexpected negative reaction to the name you like most. If you&#8217;ve asked ten people for their input and several of them really dislike your first choice, we highly advise going with your second choice. We also suggest avoiding names that are hard to pronounce and names that your company might outgrow as your line grows. (There&#8217;s nothing worse than being stuck with company names such as Diane&#8217;s Picture Frames or Doug&#8217;s Baseball Memorabilia when you&#8217;ve branched out into other areas.) At the same time, we (the public) often admire clever spellings, such as DV8 for &#8220;deviate.&#8221; Choose a name that people will remember and that you hopefully won&#8217;t grow tired of three, ten, or twenty years from now. </p><p>Your next step is to officially see if your final name choice is taken. To do this, you must run a DBA name check, which will take several weeks to complete. DBA means &#8220;doing business as&#8221; and refers to a fictitious business or trade name. You can usually hire someone locally to do your DBA search (often a newspaper office) or you can hire someone online. Check the fees for this procedure from several sources, as they will vary. </p><p>While you&#8217;re waiting for your DBA name to be finalized, it&#8217;s time to start talking with an attorney who specializes in business and with a certified public accountant. Do this now, because once your DBA pa</p></div><div class="section"><p>pers come back and your business name is official, your next steps will </p></div><p>involve making all the other aspects of your business legal as quickly as </p><p>possible. </p><p>There will be layers of paperwork: forms to fill out for the U.S. government, your state, and your municipality. These forms will include applications for your company&#8217;s <i>federal tax/employer ID number </i>(EIN), various <i>business licenses, </i>and both <i>resale and sales tax permits. </i>The list is long&#8212;and will likely make you a bit dizzy if you&#8217;re not a numbers person! However, always ask your attorney and accountant if there are easy tasks they would recommend you handle on your own. This will save you money and may save time as well. </p><p>Here are some of the issues you will be discussing with your pros first: the type of business structure you should put in place. (You can&#8217;t do this without an official name.) Should you incorporate at this point? Is it better to set up a partnership or a sole proprietorship instead of incorporating? What are the tax ramifications and your personal liabilities in each case? Your attorney and accountant will look at your situation and at the basic business plan you present and then help you determine what the most logical structure is for you <i>at this stage </i>of your business. </p><p>If you are assigning a specific name to your new product, this will also have to be addressed by copyrighting its name (also involving a name check). You may also want to get a trademark for your tag line, if necessary. Ask these questions during your initial meeting with your attorney. </p><p>In addition to all the paperwork you&#8217;re handling now with your attorney and accountant, you&#8217;ll also be able to set up a business bank account now that you have your DBA. Call your bank manager before going in to see what else they require. Usually, you&#8217;ll also be presenting a more formal version of your original letter of intent, now officially listing your company&#8217;s name. You&#8217;ll also need your federal tax ID number to open your account. </p><p>Next, you&#8217;ll probably want to apply for a business credit card and determine who within your company gets one or controls the lone credit card. If more than one of you will be using your business credit card account, sit down and have a firm discussion of what type of expenses you will put on this account. It&#8217;s wise for young companies to also determine a spending limit, whereas all single purchases above that amount need to have the approval of the majority. Unless you know the spending habits of your new partners, set limits to avoid problems that could hurt your cash flow later! </p><p><i>98 </i><i>99 </i></p><div class="section"><p>Speaking of avoiding problems, we see too many new manufacturers and artisans develop their product and packaging but forget to apply for a UPC bar code! If you plan to sell your products to supermarkets, drug stores, chain stores, mass merchants, big box companies, or any other type of account that will not buy products unless they are coded, now is the time to apply for one. </p><p>We talk about UPCs and the newer radio frequency identification codes (RFIDs) in chapter 13, but since now is the time to fill out the paperwork, here are the contacts for both (same group; different sites and names). The Uniform Code Council can be contacted at (609) 620-0200 and at (937) 435-3870 if you have questions or problems. Their Web site is uc-council.org. Their affiliate, EPC Global U.S. (RFID codes), can be reached by calling (937) 291-3300 or at their Web site, epcglobalus.org. </p><p>Once all the paperwork is filled out and approved, we recommend that you make copies of everything. Place all the originals in a safe-deposit box. Keep your copies in a lockbox in your office. If several people in your company need to access some of these account and tax ID numbers on a regular basis, agree to a formula of writing them in code in your Rolodexes. For instance, you may want to write these numbers backward or drop the first number into the last position so nosy employees or others can&#8217;t access them. It sounds silly, but these are <i>private </i>business numbers, especially those tied to money or credit accounts. If many people have easy access to your offices, keep these numbers <i>safe</i>! </p><p>Finally, so you don&#8217;t forget when payments and license renewals are due, have your accountant mark them all on your calendar for at least the first year while you get used to the rhythm of these important deadlines. Post them on the calendar two weeks before they are due <i>and </i>on the actual due date. This way you&#8217;ll have time to plan for them in a timely manner. </p><p><i>PART 2: CREATING YOUR COMPANY&#8217;S AND YOUR PRODUCT&#8217;S PAPERWORK </i></p><p>Now that all the legalities are in order, there is other paperwork to which you must attend. Luckily, this next part is more creative and can be a lot of fun! </p><p>First on the list is creating a logo (or possibly two logos; one each </p></div><div class="section"><p>for your company and your new product). Hopefully you have an idea </p></div><p>of what you want. That&#8217;s the starting point. Next, you&#8217;ll want to hire a </p><p>(graphic) designer to work out concepts with you. Listen closely to their advice. They deal with design every day and know all the freshest options in color, fonts, and graphics being used in their industry. First, give them your concept, then ask them to also submit rough sketches of one or two other ideas they will conceive on their own. (You may be pleasantly surprised to find that you&#8217;ll happily give up your idea in order to use one of theirs instead!) </p><p>To find a quality graphic artist, consider contacting the American Institute of Graphic Arts (aiga.org). You can review their local chapters or click &#8220;need a designer?&#8221; for their members list or to post a job. There is also a very cool Web site called Guru.com that permits you to &#8220;visit&#8221; up to two hundred graphic artists in your region to review their online portfolios. Another Guru.com option allows you visit the site&#8217;s top two hundred U.S. designers. The site also lists the ratings customers give each designer (up to five stars), which may quickly help you spot the best ones. Designers&#8217; hourly rates are also posted, so you won&#8217;t be surprised later. This site may be an excellent way to &#8220;interview&#8221; several candidates quickly. </p><p>You can use your new logo on all of your paperwork, including business cards, 8<sup>1</sup>&#8260;2 x 11 business letterhead, # 10 envelopes, and on your brochures, Web site, order forms, shipping labels, and other applicable items. Therefore, you&#8217;ll not only want to be happy with your logo today but years from now. Make sure it reflects well on what you do, be it high-end design or products for the mass market. Choose carefully! </p><p>Next, you&#8217;ll want to order business cards, letterhead, shipping/ mailing labels, and envelopes. You&#8217;ll likely need both standard #10s and security window envelopes the size of your invoices (which you may not have determined yet). Soon you&#8217;ll need larger envelopes for mailings to the media and to potential customers. Wait until you have determined your brochure size and other materials needs before ordering those. </p><p>There are many excellent services from which you can order stationery. You may want to develop a relationship with a local supplier, if you feel they can meet today&#8217;s very competitive prices. </p><p>Kinko&#8217;s, Office Depot, Staples, and other chains are also very good. Additionally, you can find some amazing prices online at resources that include VistaPrint.com and DiscountOfficeSupplies.com. In fact, if you need great-looking temporary business cards before you establish your logo, VistaPrint.com offers hundreds of exceptional </p><p><i>100 </i><i>101 </i></p><div class="section"><p>business card designs that are dirt cheap. They&#8217;ll even print 250 free cards for you in the design of your choice if you&#8217;ll agree to have their slogan on back. In that case you only pay shipping. Another site that offers free business cards is WePrintCheap.com. </p><p>If you&#8217;re on an extremely tight budget, as a temporary solution you may want to consider using a premade design (graphic) instead of a logo. It won&#8217;t help brand your line, but the options are now much more attractive than they were only a few years ago. VistaPrint.com offers some excellent template designs into which you can drop your business&#8217;s information. WePrintCheap.com is also among the companies offering this option. </p><p>Printing your first brochure will be easy, too. If you only have one product, you don&#8217;t even need one: just a high-quality photo of your product printed on a flyer may be enough (depending on your product&#8217;s market and the item&#8217;s price point). You may also opt for a real photo with a fact sheet about your product, though this may ultimately be very costly if you have to send a lot of 5"x 7" or 8" x 10" photos, even if they&#8217;re just black-and-white glossies. </p><p>In regards to your item&#8217;s photography, don&#8217;t skimp in this area. Hire a professional or a graduate-level photography student from a local college. In either case recruit someone who knows how to shoot <i>product </i>shots, as opposed to <i>people </i>shots. (See chapter 14 on the media for more information.) Remember: your product photo should be one of your best sales tools. Make certain that it serves as a good reminder of your wonderful creation! </p><p>Most manufacturers and artisans end up using standard-size brochures and flyers: 8<sup>1</sup>&#8260;2 x 11, the same size as a piece of letterhead. While this is a great size, sometimes something smaller or a tri-fold piece is more effective. You can be very creative with your brochure materials, depending on the market and buyers you are courting. If you&#8217;re going after a high-end market or a design, fashion, or youth market, your brochure should be savvy, colorful, and fun. If your product is for the mass market or for discount stores, you will want to do something more generic. For basic brochures, consider working (again) with VistaPrint or WePrintCheap. For generic materials, price is what counts&#8212;shop around for the lowest ones. This doesn&#8217;t mean they can&#8217;t look great; simply that some markets demand less attention to detail. For something special, consider high-quality paper, layering papers with see-through papers on top to create a peekaboo effect, using </p></div><div class="section"><p>lightweight plastics or heavy papers, and a binding to create brochure </p></div><p>booklets instead of something more mundane. Your imagination and </p><p>your budget are your only restrictions. </p><p>Make sure the copy (verbiage) in your brochure romances your product or creates a wonderful image to go with your photos. Talk about the design process and the designer, if that is important and may be of interest to buyers. (Examples: &#8220;Our unique basket designs are hand woven by peasants in Guatemala to whom we pay a quality-of-life wage.&#8221; Or &#8220;Our products are designed by Lisa Jones, who studied art at the Art Institute of Chicago and Parsons. She uses elements from her bountiful Los Angeles flower garden to create the California Collection.&#8221;) </p><p>Make sure your brochure materials clearly state the product&#8217;s name and style number. Style numbers should be sequential. Always assign a new style sequence for every new collection you create. (Example: Robbi&#8217;s Garden Tools, Inc.&#8217;s original line may start with style number RGT-101, and her second collection might start with RGT-201, etc.) Specific color choices and sizes should be listed in your brochure, too, if applicable. However, price is <i>never </i>listed in your brochures unless you are creating a very limited supply of brochures for a temporary situation. Prices are always subject to change, as labor and raw materials go up. Too many companies have had to throw away perfectly good brochures because they listed their prices there and needed to change them. Worse yet, some actually have used new price stickers to cover old prices in their brochures. This is the height of tackiness. Don&#8217;t let it happen to you: put your prices on a separate <i>price list, </i>where they belong! Then, to help you through cost increases, always have these words on your price list: &#8220;All prices are subject to change.&#8221; </p><p>Price lists should include all the vital info about your company, all the pertinent info about your products, and the prices, both individually and by the way you will be selling and packing your products: $5 each/$60 per case of 12, and so on. (It is perfectly fine to sell singles, especially if your item is very expensive.) Also list your minimum order amount, means of payment, terms (Net 30, etc.), and your <i>F.O.B. </i>This means &#8220;freight on board&#8221; and indicates the place from which your customers will start paying the freight for their shipments. Nowadays, your F.O.B. may not always be the same as your office location, especially if you are importing products and using a warehouse closer to the port of entry for your merchandise.) List all your acceptable means of payment. To encourage prepayments and credit card payments (which you will not have to worry about collecting later), consider a slight dis</p><p><i>102 </i><i>103 </i></p><div class="section"><p>count for those who order this way. The discount should be higher for prepayments. If space permits, sometimes it is also helpful to feature line drawings of your products near their descriptions and pricing, especially for a large collection of products. The drawings will help busy buyers find the information they need more quickly. Also, depending on your line, you may need separate price lists for quoting prices differently. In the furniture business, for instance, interior designers are quoted prices differently than retail stores. </p><p>All of the information on your price list except the prices will also go on your order form. Terms of payment should be listed in detail on this form, indicating any late charges and the percentage of interest you will charge if a customer doesn&#8217;t pay on time. Set up the order form with plenty of space for printing in a legible font. Clearly note the signature/date ordered area and the date box listing when the customer wants the order delivered. (We recommend boxing or otherwise highlighting the delivery date.) Also make certain that there are information fields for the customer&#8217;s &#8220;bill to&#8221; and &#8220;ship to&#8221; locations, which are often different places (especially for multiple store locations). You don&#8217;t want to deliver a gross of something to a company&#8217;s 32nd-floor office when their store is across town! </p><p>It&#8217;s best to look at several other companies&#8217; order forms if you are unfamiliar with the process of setting up a good order form (you can often review them online). Most order forms come in triplicate, with two copies for your company plus a customer copy. Decide if this is the best option for your company. </p><p>We think it&#8217;s a nice touch to have a box at the bottom of the order form thanking the customer for their business: &#8220;All of us at Mary Alice&#8217;s Pet Supplies appreciate your business and thank you for this order. We look forward to working with you again!&#8221; It&#8217;s a nice touch that helps keep communication lines open. </p></div><p><i>CHAPTER 11<br/></i></p><div class="section"><p><i>HOW TO MAKE EVERYONE<br/>HAPPY, INCLUDING YOURSELF!<br/></i></p></div><p>One of our favorite television commercials is produced for FedEx<sup>&#174;</sup>. It involves a newly minted MBA who arrives at his new corporation on a hectic day. The office manager asks him to step in and help in another corporate division. He follows her into <i>(gasp!) </i>the shipping room where she wants him to print shipping labels. She explains that <i>anyone </i>can use FedEx&#8217;s simple shipping system. &#8220;But I&#8217;m an MBA!&#8221; the new guy fires back in disbelief at the possibility of doing what he obviously feels is a lowly job. The office manager gets the last laugh when she says knowingly: &#8220;Oh, in that case I&#8217;ll have to show you how to do it.&#8221; </p><p>We love this commercial because it hits close to home for any manufacturer or artisan during the first few years of getting his or her company up and running. The only way to make all facets of a start-up work is for everyone in the company to wear a lot of different hats. Each must be able to step into different departments and help pick up the slack. Everyone must be able to drop whatever they&#8217;re doing without complaint and head into the warehouse to ship products (especially when you have several huge orders that need to be shipped at once). Making certain your customers get the right products in a timely manner, properly packaged and labeled, is paramount to your company&#8217;s survival. Additionally, all of your employees should know how to handle customer calls professionally and flawlessly. To best accommodate customers, all of your employees should consider every aspect of your business to be equally important and worthy of their efforts. </p><p>As we noted in chapter 1, it&#8217;s now possible to successfully outsource almost every aspect of a new business. It&#8217;s an efficient but generally more costly way to run your business. However, most of you will </p><div class="section"><p><i>105 </i></p><p>want to hire at least some employees as your team grows, and others&#8212; usually very hands-on individuals&#8212;will choose not to outsource at all. </p><p>But how do you create a workforce that is with you every step of the way to building a successful company? </p></div></div></div><div class="section"><div class="section"><h3><i>DETERMINING YOUR COMPANY&#8217;S SPECIFIC NEEDS </i></h3><p>The prospect of hiring and managing even one extra person is always daunting. And it&#8217;s even more so when you&#8217;re hiring your first ten or twenty-five employees! This chapter was created to help you determine the needs for your company&#8217;s first few years, a crucial time for any young business. </p><p>Before you start hiring, you&#8217;ll want to sit down and outline the critical departments any new company must have in place: creative, marketing, sales, accounting (billing, receiving, payroll, etc.), warehouse product management, and shipping. </p><p>Now under each heading note which of these you (or you and your business partners) are proficient in handling. <i>Oops: </i>you likely found one or two categories that can&#8217;t be handled well. That&#8217;s okay. Those are the areas where your young company will seek assistance first. </p><p>Next, you need to decide if you want to hire someone to work for your company directly or if you want to outsource the task. </p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="section"><h3><i>OUTSOURCING OR HIRING </i></h3><p>Years ago, your outsourcing options were minimal. Today there are excellent firms that can help you handle an entire range of business tasks. For instance, if you don&#8217;t have the funds to establish your own warehouse, consider outsourcing that task to others who can often do it for a fraction of the price you&#8217;d pay to rent, insure, outfit, and staff a proper warehouse. </p><p>Outsourcing is also available for other jobs that might otherwise be handled in-house, such as accounting, sales management, and customer service. In these situations, too, outsourcing might be an excellent initial option, though the costs may be higher than what you&#8217;d pay an employee. If you don&#8217;t need a full-time employee and can&#8217;t find an experienced part-time or flex-time employee, consider outsourcing, but keep track of your </p></div><div class="section"><p>outsourcing <br/></p><p>costs versus <br/></p><p>the expenses you would incur by hiring. </p></div><div class="section"><p><i>3M </i></p><p><i>St Paul, MN/3m.com </i></p><p><i>A ONCE SHAKY COMPANY NOW THRIVES ON ITS 15% RULE,<br/>WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE ONE OF ITS MOST FAMOUS PRODUCTS<br/></i></p><p>For new entrepreneurs, it&#8217;s sometimes difficult to remember that all companies have their ups and downs, even huge global players like 3M, which now has over $20 billion in sales worldwide each year. Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing (3M) had very humble beginnings when it was founded in northern Minnesota in 1902 by five businessmen who intended to mine mineral deposits to use as abrasives on grinding wheels. After marginal results and moves to two other cities, the company eventually found its way. It now boasts a formula for ongoing success, has a world-class invention arm, and regularly turns out new products in adhesives and related fields. Several of its products are top sellers within their category, including Scotch<sup>&#174; </sup>tape. </p><p>Another invention of &#8220;note&#8221; is Post-it<sup>&#174; </sup>Notes, developed in 1975 by 3M inventor Art Fry with the help of his colleague Dr. Spencer Silver. But the product wasn&#8217;t something either man was supposed to be working on. Instead, it came about because Fry had a personal need for bookmarks that would stay in place during his church choir sessions without permanently damaging his hymnal. Fry was allowed to work on a solution in the lab due </p></div><p>Sometimes an outside service is so exceptional, it seems silly to hire and train others to do the job. If so, consider yourself lucky. However, if your bottom line is affected, build an in-house team. </p><div class="section"><div><h5><i>Shipping and handling services </i></h5><p>There are several ways to find warehouses: First, use the search words &#8220;warehouse services&#8221; online and you&#8217;ll find many companies that meet your needs. Most offer invoicing services, too. Second, talk to other company owners to see if they use an outside service and if they can recommend one. You can also check the yellow pages. However, this may not work, as most of these services are located in the Midwest or on the East Coast. They&#8217;re based in these areas for a reason: either to be at a midway point for shipping (Midwest facilities), or to be close to the majority of the U.S. population (East Coast facilities). </p><p><i>106 </i></p><div class="section"><p>to 3M&#8217;s policy, internally referred to as the &#8220;bootlegging policy,&#8221; which allows its technical staff to spend up to 15% of company time working on projects of their own choosing. Fry&#8217;s work eventually brought him to Silver, who had developed a low-tack adhesive formula that remained sticky after several repositionings and didn&#8217;t cause damage. </p><p>The rest would be success history, if the real world worked that way. By 1977, 3M test-marketed the product in five U.S. cities with little success. That&#8217;s when the dedication of two leading members of the company&#8217;s commercial office supply division, Joe Ramey and Geoff Nicholson, saved Post-it Notes from product purgatory. The two flew to one of the test towns, Richmond, Virginia, where they made unannounced visits to banks and offices to demonstrate the product. At that time, free giveaways of new office supply products was unheard of, but their demonstrations and handouts proved wise: nearly 90% of those who tried the new product said they would buy it (50% is considered outstanding). </p><p>Today Post-it Notes are everywhere, used in book plots, on TV shows, and in movies. They&#8217;re even featured in the National Museum of American History at the Smithsonian, symbolizing their important role in our everyday lives, all because one company trusts its employees to be creative with a portion of their work time. At 3M, it seems that trust is synonymous with success. </p></div><div class="section"><p>Some of these companies offer multiple warehouses across the country. While this sounds good, we do not recommend multiple shipping locations for young companies because you would have to keep a sufficient level of stock in two or more warehouses. Instead, keep things simple: stock only one facility until you have a good handle on your needs. </p><p>Some manufacturers get the concepts of warehousing services and fulfillment centers mixed up. <i>Fulfillment centers </i>can handle shipping to your retail customers. However, many of them specialize in shipping small amounts of products to individual consumers. For instance, fulfillment centers often handle the business end of Internet shopping sites: taking orders by phone, fax, or online; doing the billing and collecting the credit card payments; and shipping the products. While some fulfillment centers also handle larger orders, most are not set up to handle wholesale business. So, if you plan to sell your product to stores, they may not be right for you. </p></div><div class="section"><p>If you decide to work with a warehouse service, choose carefully. </p></div><p>Interview several candidates (at least five) to determine which one best responds to your company&#8217;s needs. For instance, if your product is fragile, you&#8217;ll want to work with a warehouse that has had experience in handling, packing, and shipping breakable items. </p><p>Make certain they understand your concerns and needs, including those you anticipate for future products. If your company requires something beyond standard <i>pick and pack </i>(where your product can simply be pulled off a shelf, place in a shipping box, labeled, and shipped), consider resources that specialize in POP and collateral material services. <i>POP services </i>include shipping point-of-purchase displays (cardboard or simple displays like the ones you see near stores&#8217; checkout counters) or even major product displays. <i>Collateral material services </i>come into play if there are several parts that the warehouse must pull together to make a complete unit of product. This is called <i>kitting</i>. </p><p>Additionally, make sure your warehouse facility offers <i>real-time inventory management </i>that allows you access to your inventory levels regularly. Balancing inventory levels is one of the most difficult tasks for a company. This service will allow you to order or make new products on a timely basis and eliminates the tedious task of piece-by-piece inventory counts. </p><p>Finally, since it is always difficult to tell if an outsource service will work out as planned, do not sign a year&#8217;s contract unless you are extremely confident in your choice. Many warehouse companies offer both short-term and long-term contracts. Suggest a test period to see if the service will work for both of you. </p><p>It should go without saying (but we&#8217;ll say it anyway): if you go this route, you must keep your warehouse company happy. If you don&#8217;t pay them on time or if you create other problems, remember: they have your inventory and, in worse-case scenarios, they can hold your products hostage! </p><p><i>Accounting 101 </i></p><p>If your discussion with your colleagues revealed that no one is qualified to handle the accounting end of your business, your options will likely be local. From the start, it is doubtful you will need a full-time accountant in your office. Take the time to choose your CPA (certified public accountant) carefully. First, ask people you know and trust to </p><p><i>108 </i><i>109 </i></p><div class="section"><p>recommend an accountant or accounting agency. Consider contacting your local Chamber of Commerce. When you are close to making your final decision, contact the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (aicpa.org) and your state&#8217;s Department of Consumer Affairs to make certain you are hiring a reliable person or agency to handle your company&#8217;s finances. </p><p>Our friend Karen Block of Block &amp; Company in Calabasas, California also recommends that you choose an accountant who specializes in your area of business and that his or her personality is a good match to yours. You will be spending a lot of time with the person handling your finances, so feeling comfortable will be very important. </p><p>In all cases involving money, do no depend solely on others. Even though you and your partners may not have time to handle the financial aspects of your business, you must take on the responsibility of learning as much as possible about the money end of it. All of you should sign up for a basic accounting class at your local college or through a service, such as the Learning Annex. There are also college-level accounting and business management courses you can take at your own pace through accredited online services. Another option is to learn accounting basics through a Quicken Business software program, which offers learning options from lite through enterprise levels. While all of you should know the basics of accounting, at least one of you should take an advanced course. Learn about the legalities of your tax and payroll responsibilities. Learn the formula for accounts receivable and accounts payable. </p><p>Whether you decide to outsource your accounting or do it in-house, smart manufacturers learn to look over the shoulders of their accountant to make certain everything is kosher. Without at least a basic background in accounting, you can&#8217;t do that. Any qualified and ethical accountant will welcome your interest. Worry about those who don&#8217;t! </p><p><i>YOUR INITIAL SALES TEAM </i></p><p>Your sales department will probably be a combination of your sales representatives (see chapter 19) and your in-house staff. Likely you will not need a sales director or manager (who will also often handle marketing responsibilities) for at least a year or two&#8212;especially because you may not be able to afford anyone with the right qualifications until </p></div><p>then. Too often we see young companies simply assign the sales man</p><p>agement task to someone they hire fresh out of college or to a staff member who really isn&#8217;t qualified, even though they have the right level of enthusiasm and get along with the company&#8217;s sales reps. Don&#8217;t make that mistake! There are too many intricacies to this job to simply settle for anyone. Instead, enjoy the privilege of the sales management responsibilities for the short term: it will help you get to know your customers and your sales reps and their thoughts about your product and product direction. However, if you notice a member of your staff working well with your sales reps and with customers, consider paying for the extra training they will need to eventually take over the responsibilities of the important tasks of sales and marketing. </p><p><i>YOUR CREATIVE DEPARTMENT </i></p><p>You may believe that as the person who came up with your company&#8217;s initial bright idea, you have dibs on all further product development. That is only partially true. Make certain your entire staff and outside sales force understand that everyone&#8217;s creative input is welcome. Creating an initial grand idea is difficult; coming up with a second and a third equally brilliant idea takes team work, unless you&#8217;re an all-out genius. </p><p>Remember the cardinal rule of product development: no idea is a bad idea. No matter how silly it sounds, all ideas deserve your consid</p><table><tr><th>eration, even if it&#8217;s just for a minute. </th></tr><tr><th>Often </th><td>silly </td><td>ideas </td><td>evolve </td><td>into </td><td>truly </td></tr><tr><th><i>In motivating people, you&#8217;ve got </i></th><td>great ideas after a few extra voices give </td></tr><tr><th><i>to engage their minds and their </i></th><td>their input.

If you need someone to fill an important duty but aren&#8217;t yet ready for another full-time company member (or can&#8217;t afford the extra expenses yet), consider some of these options. </p><p>Not all qualified people are looking for full-time jobs, so don&#8217;t always think in those terms. If you&#8217;re running an ad in the Help Wanted section of your local paper or are using an employment agency, specify part-time or flex-time as options. You may find two very qualified people (especially young mothers or students) who would love to <i>job share</i>. You&#8217;ll get a full-time employee without the added expenses of insurance and other full-time employee benefits. </p><p>If the job slot you need to fill is one of medium to low responsibility, consider working with your community by hiring someone who is looking for a <i>welfare-to-work </i>position. Often these job candidates have acquired all the skills needed and will work hard to stay in the workforce. Many times there are monetary benefits for your company if you are willing to do further training on-site. </p><p>If you need more brain power but not necessarily more bodies, consider mentoring programs. In some communities there are organizations, including SCORE<sup>&#174; </sup>(score.org and [800] 634-0245), that offer the mentoring of highly skilled retired executives. Often these retirees are matched to young companies and will offer many hours of their time to help you develop an aspect of your business or to help you develop solutions to problems you have encountered. These services are usually free and benefit everyone involved: you get a great mentor and the retiree gets to keep his or her skills sharp while making a huge contribution to a young company. </p><p>Interns are another great option for young companies. Simply phone your local universities to see if they offer intern services and what their programs entail. Then, if your company qualifies, you get a no-cost or low-cost employee for a month, an entire summer, or longer. You simply agree to help that person develop additional skills within their field by assigning them responsibilities and supervising their work. It&#8217;s a win-win situation! </p></div><p><i>OTHER GREAT STAFFING IDEAS </i></p><p>We hope you&#8217;ll also consider hiring people with disabilities, or as they say, different abilities. The stories you hear are true; these employees will work hard to make certain you recognize their efforts. Companies that seek out employees with mental or physical disabilities are generally rewarded with great, long-term employees for their growing teams. </p><p>Additionally, make certain your team doesn&#8217;t look just like you. Diversity is not only the law of the land, it is crucial if you want to get a good cross section of opinions from your team members. It&#8217;s an important factor when you want to get different views on product development and marketing. For these reasons and more, we encourage all types of diversity for your team. It&#8217;s always a plus! </p><p><i>FORMATS FOR INTERVIEWING AND HIRING YOUR TEAM </i></p><p>Never settle for just a body to fill a position. Make certain you feel comfortable with the person before you hire him or her. In the book <i>Winning, </i>written by Jack Welch with Suzy Welch, the former CEO of General Electric talks at length about and hiring the right team. In addition to keeping them confident and inspired, he hones in on assessing people for the job, citing three crucial &#8220;screens&#8221; (or tests) they need to pass. &#8220;The first is for integrity. People with integrity tell the truth and they keep their word,&#8221; Welch writes. &#8220;The second test is for intelligence,&#8221; Welch remarks, explaining that the best job candidates will show &#8220;intellectual curiosity, with a breadth of knowledge to work with or lead other smart people in today&#8217;s complex world.&#8221; He goes on to explain, &#8220;The third ticket to the game is maturity&#8212;the ability to handle stress and setbacks, and enjoy success with equal parts of joy and humility.&#8221; Excellent advice, don&#8217;t you agree? </p><p>Recent studies have found that EQ (emotional quotient) is as important in the workplace as IQ. There are several free tests available on the Internet that can help you determine a potential employee&#8217;s emotional fitness to serve your company. (About.com is one source you might use for these tests, or consider creating your own.) </p><p>Ask a lot of skill-set questions and allow the job candidate to ask questions, too. Often what they ask will be very revealing. Check references, even if your candidate feels like a perfect fit. Think of it as insurance. </p><p><i>112 </i><i>113 </i></p><div class="section"><p>Be generous with titles, vacation and sick days, and employee benefits, but be creative and don&#8217;t go overboard. Signing bonuses or perks for signing a contract seldom work because they aren&#8217;t based on performance. Performance is what you want to reward. </p><p>Consider an indirect ownership program, which gives employees a small but important part of your company&#8217;s profits and future growth. It&#8217;s an incentive that is based on working and excelling as a team. If an ownership program is simply out of the question, consider other perks that can make your company attractive to highly skilled employees and will help ensure their long-term loyalty. Company-sponsored work or leisure trips, birthdays off, employment anniversary days remembered, or free monthly on-site services from a certified massage therapist might help tip the balance in your favor if your job candidate has multiple offers. </p><p>Finally, once you&#8217;ve selected a new team member, treat him or her as you would any member of your family. (In some cases even better!) Do something special to make certain they feel welcome on their first day. Let them know that your door (if you have one) is always open. Make a point to sit down with them at least once a month (more often at first) to find out if they have any concerns or suggestions to offer. Your team&#8217;s input as a sounding board will be crucial to your success. </p><p><i>PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER </i></p><p>For additional information on hiring staff and sales representatives, StartUPbiz.com is an excellent Web site to visit. There you will find a selection of employee templates you can use and ideas for your new employee handbook, which will help keep you and your staff on track. </p><p>If you have little experience in managing people, we also encourage you to read a few other good management books to get a variety of perspectives. The information they provide can carry you through your career as a boss with fewer missteps. A few exceptional ones are <i>High Five! The Magic of Working Together </i>by Ken Blanchard and Sheldon Bowles; another one by Blanchard and Patricia Zigarmi titled <i>Leadership and the One Minute Manager; 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership </i>and <i>The 21 Indispensable Qualities of a Leader, </i>both by John C. Maxwell. Other excellent choices are <i>The E-Myth Manager: Why Most Managers Aren&#8217;t Effective and What to Do About It </i>by Michael Gerber, and <i>The Five Dysfunctions of a Team </i>by Patrick Lencioni. </p></div><div class="section"><p>Let&#8217;s face it, you and your employees are going to be spending a lot </p></div><p>of time together over the first crucial years of your business. Many will put in a lot of extra hours that you can&#8217;t afford to cover at first. The monetary rewards for some of these helpful people may have to wait until your company is a bit more successful. In the meantime, whether you choose to set up profit sharing or some other means of rewarding your team, always make certain they know how much you appreciate their efforts. Congratulate them often on a job well done. Learn to be not only their boss but their friend and cheerleader, too. Treat them well and they&#8217;ll definitely return the favor! </p><p><i>114<br/></i></p><div class="section"><p><i>CHAPTER 12<br/></i></p><p><i>CREATING AN EFFECTIVE <br/>WEB SITE<br/></i></p><p><i>AUTHOR</i><i>&#8217;</i><i>S NOTE: </i>In this chapter we&#8217;ve listed all the questions we believe you should ask during interviews with Web designers. The list is designed for the majority of readers who know computer basics but are not familiar with the correct terminology or the components of design packages for product Web sites. These questions should help keep you in control of the process from start to finish. It will also help you save time and avoid common, costly missteps. </p></div><div class="section"><p>It&#8217;s no longer a question of <i>if </i>you should get a Web site for your business, but <i>how </i>you should build it and <i>when</i>. &#8220;When&#8221; has become an easy question to answer: build it so it&#8217;s ready the minute you&#8217;re ready to sell products. Web sites have become such vital business tools that they absolutely must be part of your initial business plan. </p><p>The &#8220;how&#8221; is more difficult because every manufacturer or artisan must find the unique Web solution to match his or her company&#8217;s needs, expectations, and personality. How you and your Web designer arrive at those conclusions will be based on carefully asked questions from you and completely answered responses from them. </p><p>First, however, we want to present some figures from the June 2004 issue of <i>Internet Retailer </i>magazine (internetretailer.com), based on a recent study commissioned by the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors, called <i>Facing the Forces of Change </i>by Paul Demery. He predicts that by 2008: </p></div><div class="section"><p><i>1. </i></p><p>33% of retailers will expect to gather product information from wholesalers&#8217; Web sites. </p><ol><li>34% of retailers will expect to access pricing information online. </li><li>36% of retailers will expect to communicate with wholesalers&#8217; sales staff via e-mail. </li><li>83% of wholesale distributors will expect their retail customers to require some form of electronic ordering. </li><li>Overall, online ordering will expand to 37% of orders. </li><li>27% of retailers will expect to review purchase history online. </li></ol><p>In other words, retailers will want easy access to your line 24/7. </p></div><p>You have to keep retailers&#8217; needs in mind throughout your development. Or perhaps you&#8217;ll want to keep the needs of individual consumers in your thoughts. Most industry sources suggest that you don&#8217;t sell direct to consumers on your Web site unless a direct sales program is your complete market plan. If you sell to both retailers and consumers on your Web site, it sends mixed signals. We highly suggest choosing one or the other. </p><p>According to our own JoAnne Stone-Geier, who specializes in business Web site development: &#8220;A good Web site is much more than a sales tool: it&#8217;s also your PR agent, your direct marketing program, your catalog, your sales staff, and an efficient and timely way to keep in touch with your customers and potential customers. If your line is new and your Web site is a good one, it will help you level the playing field with other manufacturers. A Web site can quickly become a cost-effective tool, even though it will be one of your biggest start-up expenses.&#8221; </p><p>Meanwhile, you should note that the average Web site takes from 6 to 18 weeks to develop, so plan your time accordingly! </p><p><i>CHOOSING THE RIGHT WEB DESIGNER </i></p><p>No matter what your budget, one of your most important decisions will be choosing a <i>Web designer</i>. This is where you should never skimp on costs. A good designer will help you brand your site, creating an image that will convey your company&#8217;s personality. As you&#8217;ll soon see, </p><p><i>116 </i><i>117 </i></p><div class="section"><p>selecting the right person to design your company&#8217;s Web site is about a lot more than just creative skills. Functionality is the most important component of a business Web site, so choosing someone who understands the business side of your needs will be crucial. </p><p>To find an experienced Web designer who will understand your needs, review wholesale and retail Web sites in your industry. (Remember, it&#8217;s best to work with someone who lives near you, but it isn&#8217;t completely necessary. You can always communicate by phone, fax, courier or overnight service, and, of course, e-mail.) </p><p>If you don&#8217;t see what you envision, check with one of these organizations: Independent Computer Consultants Association (icca.org), the Association for Information Technology Professionals (aitp.org), the Computer &amp; Communications Industry Association (ccianet.org), or the eMarketing Association (emarketingassociation.com). These groups can put you in touch with Web designers who live in your community. You can also contact your local Chamber of Commerce or ask the faculty of a technical college in your area. Whatever you do, find <i>several </i>Web designers to interview. </p><p>Your first interviews with candidates should be done over the phone to save time and help you judge if you&#8217;d like working together. Here&#8217;s what you will need to ask and why: </p><ol><li>Do you specialize in developing marketing Web sites? (Due to marketing Web sites&#8217; complexity, we suggest you go no further if the response to the first question is negative.) </li><li>Have you developed Web sites for manufacturers or retailers? If so, how many? </li><li>Can you send your references and a list of the wholesale or retail sites you&#8217;ve developed? (We suggest at least ten references and a similar number of sites.) </li><li>If we choose your services, will you be doing the designing personally? (Some popular designers may hand projects to their associates.) </li><li>Can you tell me your approximate turnaround time for working with me? (If they&#8217;re too busy, you may want someone else.) </li></ol><p>It&#8217;s crucial to hire someone who understands the retail/wholesale </p></div><div class="section"><p>arena. You want a person with marketing expertise, not just a techie. If </p></div><p>you have to explain your business to them, chances are they&#8217;re not </p><p>right for you. Let functionality and user-friendliness be your key words when discussing your site. A little animation goes a long way; don&#8217;t let your Web designer talk you into more. </p><p><i>SECOND INTERVIEW WITH A WEB DESIGNER<br/>FROM YOUR &#8220;SHORT LIST&#8221; OF CANDIDATES<br/></i></p><p>Now that things are getting serious, ask more questions about what are called the backend services (the technical stuff). Find out what services your candidates provide beyond design. Whatever they don&#8217;t provide will be extra and you will need to ask for costs (or approximate costs) on those categories, too. You&#8217;ll find out by asking: </p><div class="section"><ol><li>Does your company do the Web hosting? </li><li>Will you manage all the technical aspects and the changes in the site? (We suggest that they train someone from your staff to do basic script changes but that they do the rest.) </li><li>Will you submit the site to major search engines, and if so, which ones? (Popular search engines include Goggle, Alta Vista, Yahoo, and Tahoma.) </li><li>Will you be able to help determine the best <i>meta tags </i>for my line? (Meta tags are word combinations people use to search for a topic or a product on the Internet. For instance, if you are creating a line of umbrellas, your meta tags should be words or combinations like &#8220;umbrellas,&#8221; &#8220;rain umbrellas,&#8221; and &#8220;rain gear.&#8221; Never use a meta tag that is too broad; it will seldom get the results you want. Example: use &#8220;baby gifts&#8221; or &#8220;gifts for teachers&#8221; instead of &#8220;gifts.&#8221;) </li><li>Do you already work with an established search engine firm that can optimize my Web site? (Prices vary; some good ones are advertising.com, iprospect.com, and oneupweb.com. Optimization is altering the Web site so it will rank higher for particular terms in crawler-based search engines.) </li><li>Will you be creating my doorway pages? (Doorway pages help tighten searches for your product. For instance, if you offer a </li></ol></div><p><i>118 </i><i>119 </i></p><div class="section"><p>line of business invitations, your doorway pages might be &#8220;business pages&#8221; and &#8220;hospitality pages.&#8221;) </p><ol><li>Will you pursue linking with other sites with similar products<br/>or communities? (You may want to link to trade associations,<br/>to sales sites such as Whereoware.com, and to city or regional<br/>links.)<br/></li><li>What other marketing services will you provide, and what<br/>software programs do you use? (Make sure they use a market<br/>ing service that is applicable to your business and that they set<br/>you up with a software program that has a template for whole<br/>salers and retailers.) <br/></li><li>What CRM (customer relationship management) program do<br/>you use? (There are hundreds, so make sure the one chosen is<br/>applicable to your business or is one that can be adapted.)<br/></li><li>Do you have proprietary software? If so, who else uses it? If not, can you develop it? (Any designer who specializes in working with wholesalers and retailers will have developed a specific software program for CRM, and all of their clients may be using the same one.) </li><li>Which database program do you use? (There are hundreds. You&#8217;ll want one that has flexibility and can integrate into your inventory system, CRM, and other programs.) </li><li>Which e-commerce program do you use, and can it be adapted to my products and options? </li><li>Will you help me set up a merchant account or a third party such as Pay Pal or Paymentech? </li><li>Can you help me obtain a digital certificate? (This is your security when customers place orders by credit card over the Internet. Verisign Secure Site, at www.verisign.com, is the most common digital certificate.) </li><li>How many products can be put on my site for your base price? </li><li>Will the products be digitally photographed or scanned? Can the photos be transferred so that I can also use them for my print catalogues? (This will save you time and money.) </li><li>Who will be monitoring my site for problems? </li><li>How will I be receiving my daily and monthly reports? </li></ol></div><p><i>YOUR SPECIFIC DESIGN PROJECT </i></p><p>After asking those questions, it will be clear whether your Web designer is a full or medium service or strictly a design option for you. If he or she might be a good Web designer for your needs, next ask: </p><div class="section"><ol><li>Who should provide the written copy for the site? (You should have a very clear idea of what you want if someone else will be writing it.) </li><li>What do you charge for mock-ups? </li><li>What do you charge for changes? </li><li>Do you charge by the hour or by the project? (If by the hour, ask for an estimate.) </li><li>What are the up-front fees and your payment schedule for the rest of the project? </li><li>Once the site is finished, who owns the copyright to the site? </li></ol></div><p><i>LET&#8217;S DO IT! </i></p><p>Once you are ready to hire someone, here is what you must clarify at the end: </p><div class="section"><ol><li>What is your client schedule at the moment, and how do I fit into it? </li><li>Can you give me a written proposal noting all aspects of the contract and the timeline? (Remember, it shouldn&#8217;t take more than 6 to 18 weeks!) </li></ol></div><p><i>LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION! </i></p><p>Now that you have a Web designer, you&#8217;re ready to get started. Your site&#8217;s domain name is very important. Search to make certain no one else owns the rights to it. (If so, you may want to try buying it.) </p><p>If your domain name is available, we highly suggest also buying all the alternative spellings to your company&#8217;s name and tag line in the .com, .net, .biz, and even .org domains. In today&#8217;s market they should </p><p><i>120 </i><i>121 </i></p><div class="section"><p>cost about $25 to $30 each. You may also want to buy other names that sound similar or may otherwise conflict with your choice. </p><p><i>WHAT WE WANT TO SEE ON YOUR NEW WEB SITE </i></p><p>Here are our thoughts on making your Web site more customer friendly: </p><ol><li>Have an &#8220;About Us&#8221; section that includes information about your company&#8217;s goals, bios, and history. This allows customers to connect with your team <i>beyond </i>your products. </li><li>In your &#8220;Contact Us&#8221; area, list your complete address, local and toll-free phone numbers, fax number, and the e-mail addresses of people most likely to be contacted by your customers. Do not offer a generic <i>info@ </i>option! Consider having a personalized auto-reply installed that instantly pops up with messages such as &#8220;Thank you for your e-mail, Matthew! Your comments are important to us. We will be in touch within 48 hours.&#8221; (Then make sure that always happens.) </li><li>List the trade shows and other industry events where retailers can see your line in person. </li><li>Make it easy to sign up for e-mail alerts or newsletters with a clear link on your home page. </li></ol><p><i>CREATING A SMOOTH FLOW TO YOUR SITE </i></p><p>As a sales tool, your pages will need to flow in a logical, organized manner. </p><p>If you have a large product selection, consider organizing by price point, lifestyle use, or seasonal pieces as menu options. If your line is large, also think of installing a search function so customers can find an item they need by name or style number. Keep photos as a thumbnail that can be enlarged. Show details if there is a pattern or if a piece is offered in different colors. But, remember: this is not a catalog page. Buyers should be excited by the way they experience your photos and want to see more. </p><p>On the other hand, if your line is small, highlight the item photos </p></div><div class="section"><p>(which can be large) with all of the items&#8217; sales advantages. These </p></div><p>pages will have more copy. &#8220;Romance&#8221; your products in a sentence or </p><p>two, or use a bit of wit to make your customers smile. </p><p>If you&#8217;re offering lots of options, don&#8217;t clutter your pages. Use pull-down menus to help buyers access the information they want. Support your retailers by putting in a zip code function that will give the retailer nearest the consumers who also come to your site. (Consider having separate retailer and consumer entry portals, so they don&#8217;t get retail and wholesale prices mixed up!) </p><p>If you&#8217;re using the site to sell directly to retailers, you&#8217;ll need a shopping cart function and passwords. As your company develops, you can add a program that will show real-time inventory. Later on, you can even connect to your customers&#8217; inventory levels and alert them to reorder. Work with your designer and build in the openings for those advance options now, especially if you plan to sell to big box and other large accounts. It will be less costly than having to invent the system when your growth demands it. </p><p><i>CREATING DATABASE MARKETING AND<br/>E-MAIL MARKETING<br/></i></p><p>Your ultimate goal is to create a database that allows you to import, store, and maintain customer and prospect data from all the touch points in a single place. For instance, you&#8217;ll want the customer info you request on your Web site to match the information you gather at trade shows and through direct mail pieces&#8212;all in the same format. This will allow you to integrate your customer and prospect information, and then use your CRM program to track the life cycle of each customer. For instance, do they only purchase from you during the holidays? This will help you measure the effectiveness of your e-mails and other materials. (Remember: e-mails should only be sent to customers who give you permission to contact them that way. On your home page, make sure you give customers and visitors the option of signing up for your promotions and newsletters.) </p><p><i>TESTING YOUR WEB SITE </i></p><p>It&#8217;s important to test your Web site before it officially airs. Have your friends and staff check for the following possible glitches (you&#8217;ll need </p><p><i>122 </i><i>123 </i></p><div class="section"><p>to check this several times from different computers over a period of days): </p><ol><li>Does my Web site take too long to open? </li><li>Does the home page show my company&#8217;s personality, or do we need to tweak it? </li><li>Are all the pages consistent in feel and look? Are they balanced? </li><li>Is it easy to read? Do any of the pages look too busy? </li><li>Are there too many products on the pages, and are the photos too small/too dark/too light to be effective? </li><li>Are my company&#8217;s address, phone and fax numbers, and contact names/e-mails easy to locate? (This is one of the most troublesome aspect of many sites!) </li><li>Does the &#8220;back&#8221; button work? </li><li>Are all features necessary? </li><li>Is the &#8220;search&#8221; feature in place? </li><li>Is the Web site missing anything you were promised? </li><li>Is the spelling and grammar okay? (Triple-check this!) </li><li>How is the browser compatibility? (Different browsers such as Microsoft Explorer will have subtle variances in the way they read color. If there are big ones, your Web designer will need to adjust this.) </li><li>Is your privacy policy featured? </li></ol><p><i>PROMOTING YOUR WEB SITE </i></p><p>Don&#8217;t forget to promote your Web site address on all of your packaging, brochures, flyers, and mailings. These pieces should look like your Web site, branded with the same colors, style, fonts, and tag lines. </p><p>Also, promote your Web site in Internet press releases, which can be sent through prweb.com. You can also be added to Internet lists. Access these links at listnet.com and at list-universe.com. </p></div><p><i>ALTERNATIVES AND ADDITIONS TO CONSIDER </i></p><p>If money is holding you back, there may be a temporary solution for you. Contact your trade association to find out if they have a template site for vendors under an <i>umbrella program </i>that can be accessed by your target retailers. This is a small corner of their site, devoted to profiling members. You may be able to post basic contact information and a few photos. For those of you creating Web sites, simply add a link to your association&#8217;s Web site. </p><p>Additionally, as we briefly mentioned earlier, Web sites that court retail buyers, such as Whereoware.com, create add-on opportunities beyond your own Web site. Thousands of buyers from anywhere in the world can go to Whereoware and shop for hundreds of products. While Web sites such as this one are still in their infancy, they are the wave of the future for doing business between market visits. And we say: <i>Catch the wave! </i></p><p><i>124<br/></i></p><div class="section"><p><i>CHAPTER 13<br/></i></p><p><i>THE KEYS TO GOOD CUSTOMER<br/>RELATIONSHIPS <br/></i></p><p>Product labeling, packaging, and shipping are three of the most thankless jobs in the manufacturing process. They&#8217;re aspects of business that most people think of only as an afterthought. Maybe that&#8217;s why so many costly mistakes occur in these important phases of product development. </p><p>Yes, that&#8217;s right&#8212;product <i>development</i>! </p><p>If all new manufacturers would think of these tasks as part of their overall development strategy with each new product they create, they&#8217;d be able to avoid common errors, save money, and keep customers happy! </p><p>The easiest way to determine your specific packaging needs is to think about them in this order: <i>inner packaging </i>(decorative or functional packaging that often stays on a product in a store setting), <i>labeling, </i>and <i>shipping cartons</i>. In the last part of this chapter we&#8217;ll give you packaging trend resources and discuss what to do when you need to ship your product to major retailers. </p><p><i>EYE APPEAL: INNER PACKAGING </i></p><p>The first thing you need to analyze is how consumers and retailers will want to see your product packaged at the store level. Ask yourself these questions: </p><p><i>Will inner packaging help keep my product from breaking, scratching, chipping, or falling apart? </i></p></div><p>There&#8217;s nothing worse for customers than having to sort through a se</p><p>lection of merchandise just to find one piece that isn&#8217;t marred, damaged, or incomplete. If your product is made of glass, lightweight plastic, acrylic, or another fragile material, you need to protect it from careless customers. </p><p>The same is true if your product is made of fabric&#8212;especially in high-traffic stores. Is your product a solid color fabric or a busy pattern? If it&#8217;s a solid color, dirt, grime, and grease will show more easily. </p><p>All of these factors will help you decide if you need product packaging, such as a box, a bag, or shrink-wrap. Many a product has had to be deep discounted in stores simply because of damage caused by customers or store personnel. So, do everyone a favor and protect your goods. Then if retailers remove the packaging, it&#8217;s their fault something got damaged, not yours. </p><p><i>Will your item often be purchased as a gift? </i></p><p>If this is likely, you may want to provide special inner packaging of some kind, as shoppers often ask for it. Check into the possibility of durable, decorative boxes (made of cardboard or other materials) or at least a white, coated cardboard box instead of the plain-Jane natural corrugated carrier. Decorative boxes usually cost a little more, but you&#8217;ll impress your retailers and win kudos with their customers for very little extra effort. </p><p><i>Will some of your target customers have special packaging requirements? </i></p><p>Manufacturers and artisans who hope to sell to QVC, HSN, online retailers, and catalog companies should note that these merchants often won&#8217;t even consider your product unless you provide both outer cartons and inner individual packaging. Many post this information on the vendor pages of their Web sites, so you can find out ahead of time. </p><p>If you didn&#8217;t answer &#8220;yes&#8221; to any of the above questions, you may not need inner packaging. If that&#8217;s the case, you can forgo the extra effort of creating something people won&#8217;t use and retailers may just throw away. In today&#8217;s eco-conscious society that will be appreciated, too. </p><p><i>126 </i><i>127 </i></p><div class="section"><p><i>LABELING AND INSTRUCTIONS </i></p><p>If your item needs product or assembly instructions, requires a list of contents, or is required to carry precautionary warnings, you&#8217;ll need either a product booklet, a special label, or a durable hangtag to provide this information if it is not noted clearly on inner packaging. </p><p>Uncertain if your product needs to carry use instructions, ingredients, or precautionary notations? Here are the government agencies you should contact to find out the status of your specific product: </p><p>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is the best place to start. The business section of their Web site provides a list of publications available online. They cover many product categories, including furniture, jewelry, toys, clothing, and many more. Go to ftc.gov for additional information. </p><p>While at the FTC Web site, make certain you read these two additional documents: the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act and the Bioterrorism Act. Both provide important information that can keep you in line with government regulations. </p><p>Additionally, your product may need to be evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This agency&#8217;s domain is much broader than its name implies. The types of items that must pass FDA inspection include: beverages; cosmetics (including many personal care and beauty items); drugs; food; medical devices; pet/animal foods; grooming products; and radiation-emitting products (such as cell phones, lasers, and microwave-emitting products), plus several other items listed as &#8220;combination products.&#8221; You&#8217;ll find specific information at fda.gov. </p><p>In regards to proper labeling, one of the most important things to remember is that regulations are constantly changing. Recent packaging modifications mandated by the FDA have given the public more precise nutritional information. The latest push is to get more consumer-friendly labels that list ingredient names that people can understand. This is especially important to consumers with food and skin allergies. </p><p>If all of this seems too difficult or time consuming to handle on your own, you can use a paid service or a consultant to help you become compliant. One particularly helpful company is the FDA Registrar Corporation at fdaregistrar.com and (757) 224-0177. For a nominal fee, they help both U.S. and international companies cut </p></div><p>through the red tape of government regulations. (Their prices are </p><p>clearly posted on their Web site, which is available in English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Russian, and German.) They specialize in helping food and beverage companies, with over half their clients coming from outside the United States. Their staff includes lawyers and scientists at their main facility in Virginia, and they have offices throughout the world to provide regional assistance to importers. </p><div class="section"><p><i>Shmaltz Brewing Company </i></p><p><i>San Francisco, CA/shmaltz.com </i></p><p><i>MICRO-BREWERY FOUNDER CREATES A SUCCESSFUL <br/>BUSINESS AS A ONE-MAN-SHOW<br/></i></p><p>If you&#8217;re looking for a symbol of multitasking business success, you need look no further than Jeremy Cowan, the founder and proprietor of the company responsible for HE&#8217;BREW<sup>&#174;</sup>: &#8220;The Chosen Beer.&#8221; Cowan has delighted thousands of Americans with his quality beer and with the over-the-top humor he uses to market his popular brand. And while his company&#8217;s three special brews (Genesis Ale, Messiah Bold, and Miraculous Jewbelation) are now widely available across the United States and his company&#8217;s legend has spread internationally, Cowan still runs Shmaltz Brewing as a one-man operation. </p><p>Cowan, who majored in English at Stanford, tells us he originally wanted to challenge the clich&#233; that &#8220;Jews don&#8217;t drink beer.&#8221; He told us his initial business plan &#8220;was never about a way to make money but a way to take my vision and put it into the world.&#8221; </p><p>Back in 1996, with a $2,000 investment and a hundred cases of Genesis Ale, Cowan launched HE&#8217;BREW at an arty San Francisco Chanukah bash, Challahpalooza. Gifting some of the beer to friends that year, Cowan starting delivering the rest to local accounts he established, often getting up at 4 a.m. and using his grandmother&#8217;s Volvo to make deliveries. </p><p>Eventually, Cowan lined up a lot of positive press and enthusiastic distributors for his company. When we asked Cowan whether his kosher beer and the Jewish humor he uses to promote it appeal to a mainly Jewish audience, he noted, &#8220;Originally it was about 80/20, then 60/40, and now I&#8217;m wondering if it&#8217;s even 50/50, as we sell a lot of beer in places like Tampa and Orlando that don&#8217;t have large Jewish populations.&#8221; Cowan also notes that his </p></div><div class="section"><p><i>129<br/></i></p><p><i>Additional Labeling to Increase Your Customer Base </i></p><p>As consultants to many food, beverage, and personal care companies, we always stress the importance of kosher certification, when applicable. The demand for kosher products has skyrocketed across the United States in recent years to become a $6 billion industry. Demand is being driven by a diverse community of people: observant Jews and Muslims, people with shellfish allergies, vegans, and by a sizable por</p><p>distributors&#8217; staffs are very diverse. &#8220;In New York our distributor SKI, which stands for Spanish/Korean/Italian, has a lot of Dominicans, Arabs, and even a Russian guy out selling our beer.&#8221; There and in other places across the country, you can find HE&#8217;BREW in bodegas as well as in delis, in small Jewish bookstores, and in national chains, such as Whole Foods<sup>&#174; </sup>Market. </p><p>While Cowan has handled every aspect of his company other than the brewing itself, his humorous marketing skills are especially keen. &#8220;I get feedback every week from all over the world about how much they like the brand and are attracted to the shtick,&#8221; Cowan explains. HE&#8217;BREW&#8217;s Web site showcases his nonstop humor. When Cowan introduced Miraculous Jewbelation in late 2004 as &#8220;the most extreme Chanukah beer ever created,&#8221; the company&#8217;s Web site noted the importance of the number 8 in relationship to Chanukah and to Jews worldwide. But after noting the number&#8217;s religious significance, Cowan&#8217;s tale goes on to mention that &#8220;Einstein couldn&#8217;t read until 8 . . . Mel Brooks stole a cap gun from Woolworths at 8 . . . and Winona Ryder had 8 prescription medications in her purse when arrested for shoplifting.&#8221; </p><p>Yet while humor will remain an important part of HE&#8217;BREW&#8217;s future, Cowan admits that he now finds more time to concentrate on the serious aspects of growing his business. He set a goal to grow his brand to 20,000 cases in 2004, and he exceeded that figure. He also notes that there is a new-found emphasis on making his micro-brand even better. &#8220;Miraculous Jewbelation really emphasizes our beer&#8217;s unique, high quality,&#8221; Cowan told us, explaining that his skills in formulating beer have improved over the past few years. </p><p>His advice to our readers is this: &#8220;It can be valuable to be a one-person show for awhile. You have to do so many different things, it helps you find out what you&#8217;re really good at.&#8221; In Cowan&#8217;s case that seems to be just about everything. </p></div><p>tion of the general population who simply trust the kosher seal of ap</p><p>proval. There are several organizations that offer certification. To compare prices, the four largest&#8212;according to <i>Kosher Today </i>magazine&#8212;are Orthodox Union (oukosher.org and [212] 613-8249), OK Labs (ok.org and [718] 756-7500), KOF-K (kof-k.org and [201] 8370500), and Star-K (star-k.com and [410] 484-4110). For international manufacturers, Star-K&#8217;s Web site is available in English, Spanish, Chinese, and Portuguese. Meanwhile, some U.S. producers may want to consider working with a regional kosher certification group. If that&#8217;s the case, check your local listings. </p><p>With the growing Muslim population in the United States and Canada, there is another certification process we often recommend. It is called halal (meaning &#8220;lawful&#8221; or &#8220;permitted&#8221;). Islamic and kosher dietary rules have some interesting similarities and differences. For instance, both ban pork products and insist on noncruel methods of slaughtering, but halal dietary laws permit shellfish consumption. Another difference is that halal regulations do not permit any form of liquor in food production, including vanilla extract and several other flavorings that use an alcohol base. To see if your products will qualify for halal certification, contact the Islamic Food and Nutrition Council of America (IFANCA) at ifanca.org and at (773) 283-3708. Like its kosher counterparts, the IFANCA Web site and certification forms are easy to understand and use. </p><p>Product vendors should note that kosher and halal certification is not just for food and beverages. It can apply to many other categories as well, including cosmetics, health and beauty products, and even hair brushes. </p><p>Both halal and kosher certification take time and cost money, but we believe they can be well worth your efforts. Both customer bases are very loyal to manufacturers who take the time to qualify. Certification on your product&#8217;s packaging, if appropriate for your product, will enhance your sales. </p><p><i>ENCODING YOUR PRODUCTS FOR<br/>IDENTIFICATION, SERVICE, AND SAFETY<br/></i></p><p>By now, all American consumers and many others around the world are familiar with bar codes on products. The ability of merchants to scan information from these unique product fingerprints has helped </p><p><i>130 </i><i>131 </i></p><div class="section"><p>streamline shipping, retail sales, and inventory control. Bar codes, also called uniform product codes (UPCs), are popular and necessary tools for doing business with many American merchants. </p><p>However, the world seems to be moving quickly to an even more efficient tool. Radio frequency identification codes (RFIDs) can do a lot of amazing things that both please and scare consumers. RFIDs, which can be embedded into a product or its packaging, provide information long after a product has left the store. What scares people is the &#8220;big brother&#8221; aspect of companies being able to determine consumer usage in home settings. On the other hand, what amazes people is the ability of these codes to help consumers determine if a perishable item is past its due date and could make someone ill. And that&#8217;s just one of the positive aspects of RFID usage. </p><p>While consumers, retailers, product producers, and government officials continue to dialogue about the pros and cons of RFIDs use, one thing is certain: they&#8217;re not going away. In fact, some big retailers such as Wal-Mart and Target are already using this technology in limited ways. Both are starting to keep track of all shipments by asking manufacturers to apply RFID codes on each carton or pallet they ship. However, neither retailer has started using RFIDs on individual products. When that will become commonplace in the United States is still up for debate. However, RFIDs are readily used in other countries, so expect the U.S. debate to end soon&#8212;with RFIDs the likely winner! </p><p>For additional information on UPCs and RFIDs, there are two Web sites you can visit: the Uniform Code Council, Inc. (UPCs) can be found at uc-council.org or by calling (609) 620-0200; you can find EPC Global U.S. (RFIDs) at epcglobalus.org and also at the number above. </p><p><i>GETTING YOUR PRODUCT THERE SAFELY: SHIPPING CARTONS </i></p><p>Shipping cartons will be your next concern. This is a job best handled by an expert. But don&#8217;t fear: your expert will be available free of charge at your packaging supply house. We also recommend that you contact the U.S. Postal Service and any other major shippers you plan to use, such as UPS and FedEx, to determine the box sizes they accept. (Staying within standard shipping sizes whenever possible will save your customers money.) </p></div><div class="section"><p>There </p><p>are several excellent sources for packing materials&#8212;too<br/></p></div><p>many for us to list here. However, our research turned up an exceptional one-stop source called Uline (uline.com and [800] 958-5463). With over 700 sizes of boxes in stock and over 10,000 packing products, this company can handle all of your inner and outer packaging needs. Uline doesn&#8217;t have a minimum order, a real plus for young companies that are still trying to determine their monthly packaging needs. Better yet, if you order by 6 p.m. Eastern time, they&#8217;ll ship your goods the same day! Uline has warehouses throughout the United States plus a facility in Mexico, which may be helpful to those producing goods south of the border. Unlike several other resources, they also provide a huge color catalog that makes shopping easier. To find additional packaging resources, search &#8220;packaging&#8221; online or check your yellow pages under the same listing. </p><p>While determining your own product&#8217;s inner packaging and shipping needs, don&#8217;t forget to check out the latest packing materials, too. We highly recommend you use something that won&#8217;t be too messy when retailers and consumers are unpacking your goods. We&#8217;re especially fond of the new Airplus Excel airbags by Storopack. If your supplier doesn&#8217;t carry these pillowlike packers, consider contacting the company directly in the United States at storopack.com and at (800) 827-7225 (Eastern U.S.) or at (800) 829-1491 (Western U.S.). </p><p>Worried about keeping things cold during shipping? If your company specializes in perishable items, you&#8217;ll also want to ask your supplier about new technology being used in cool packs. </p><p><i>STAYING ON TOP OF PACKAGING TRENDS </i></p><p>To find out more about packaging and packing trends, check out the Institute of Packaging Professionals Web site at iopp.org and the Point-Of-Purchase Advertising International Web site at popai.org. Another excellent source for ongoing information is the magazine <i>Packaging Digest, </i>which offers free monthly e-mail updates about packaging. You&#8217;ll find their Web site at packagingdigest.com. </p><p><i>132 </i><i>133 </i></p><div class="section"><p><i>SHIPPING TO BIG ACCOUNTS </i></p><p>As former department store buyers, we know the headaches involved in shipping to chain stores and other big accounts. We&#8217;ve seen manufacturers watch their profit margins evaporate when major accounts take discounts for every deviation made from their specified shipping standards. Believe us: you can&#8217;t afford to make shipping errors with the big guys! Worst of all, if you make costly mistakes when shipping to big accounts, you might not get another chance to prove yourself&#8212;even if you have a highly desirable product. </p><p>To avoid costly errors, the minute you secure a signed order from one of these accounts, sit down and read every word on the front and back of the order&#8212;especially the fine print. Once you understand every rule of the retailer&#8217;s shipping standards, call a meeting to formulate your shipping/billing game plan. And make certain that everyone involved in the shipping and billing process knows precisely what to do. Then double- and triple-check your shipment, labels, and all paperwork before the shipment leaves your facility. </p><p>Like you, retailers and consumers may not want to think about packaging and shipping, but when a gift arrives broken with no time to replace it, or when an entire shipment is packed wrong, suddenly their headache becomes yours. If you take the time to learn proper packaging and labeling from the start, everyone wins, leading to repeat business and even more success. That&#8217;s something worth celebrating! </p></div><div class="section"><p><i>CHAPTER 14<br/></i></p><p>Getting your company&#8217;s name and your product&#8217;s image before the public <i>for free </i>may seem like a feat of pure magic, but it isn&#8217;t. It&#8217;s something almost anyone can achieve if they have a creative edge and a bit of know-how. Luckily, there are many ways to create this magic for your line, and heighten your product&#8217;s success. </p><p>This chapter will teach you what to do&#8212;and equally important, what <i>not </i>to do&#8212;to get the exposure you need from the start. Because many manufacturers and artisans never learn the right steps to take, this information will put you light-years ahead of your competition. </p><p>To achieve this magic, you can either build a solid media relations foundation in-house or hire a media agent (also called a PR agent) to work with you. Agents usually charge anywhere from $500 for a basic mailing to trade publications and follow-up calls to thousands of dollars for more extensive media coverage. When their prices are higher, it may reflect their expertise or just the going rates in their field. For instance, TV specialists usually charge much more than press specialists. While hiring an agent can be very helpful, and may land you more media opportunities due to your agent&#8217;s strong connections with editors and producers, you can also achieve a fair amount of media success on your own. So if your budget allows it, interview a few agents to see if you find a good match for your company. But if not, it&#8217;s not the end of the world: some manufacturers and artisans learn to handle the media quite well on their own. You could be one of them! </p><p>The main tool we&#8217;ll discuss throughout this chapter is the <i>media kit, </i>which includes a short news release about your product, as well as visuals and various other materials enclosed in an envelope or a folder </p></div><p>(more about this later). Many people call this packet a <i>press kit, </i>an old-</p><p>fashioned but still valid name for your presentation to media decision-makers. At one time, the majority of these kits went to the press&#8212;newspaper and magazine editors. Today they&#8217;re as likely to be sent to television or radio producers and their staffs, or to online news and trend resources. With the explosion of new cable television channels and Internet sites in recent years, the audience for your product&#8217;s debut is now enormous. The difficult part is capturing the attention and respect of those who will ultimately decide whether to green light your product for free media exposure. </p><p>As consultants, editors, and show managers, we&#8217;ve reviewed literally thousands of media kits in recent years. Indeed, some have had that special magic&#8212;and we&#8217;ve remembered the products they introduced to us for years after. Sometimes the products highlighted in those media kits were the stars. But other times the products were just good, but a <i>great </i>presentation elevated our opinions of them. <i>Voila: </i>green light! </p><p>On the flip side, countless media kits have left us cold. Occasionally, awful print presentations have been offset by great visuals (photos or a product CD). However, that&#8217;s an exception. Usually bad kits end up in the editor&#8217;s or producer&#8217;s &#8220;vertical file&#8221;&#8212;aka, the trash can. </p><p>Since the competition for free space in publications and on the air is fierce, a superb media presentation does a lot to get your product noticed. In fact, most decision-makers (editors and producers or their staff) must be sufficiently impressed with a media kit&#8217;s presentation at first glance. If they&#8217;re not, they&#8217;ll move on to the next candidate. </p><p><i>CREATING YOUR DREAM LIST </i></p><p>Before you even start to think about creating your media presentations, you&#8217;ll want to consider your target audience. Where do you envision your product being promoted? Make a list. Ask others in your company and all your close friends to make lists, too, because each list will yield fresh, surprising ideas. </p><p>Here&#8217;s an example of a medium-size wish list: &#8220;I envision my new product getting coverage in <i>Metropolitan Home, House Beautiful, Elle D&#233;cor, Entrepreneur, </i>all the pertinent trade magazines, the home sections of newspapers in the top twenty U.S. cities, plus coverage on <i>In-Style</i>&#8217;s Internet trend section.&#8221; Here&#8217;s another, very different, example: &#8220;I hope for coverage in all the teen magazines, <i>People, InStyle, Lucky, </i>a </p><p><i>138 </i><i>139 </i></p><div class="section"><p>few of the Internet sites for tweens and teen girls, and on television shows such as <i>The O.C. </i>and <i>Gilmore Girls</i>.&#8221; Very different lists, equally diverse initial goals. </p><p>As you put together your list, remember these important points: free coverage in newspapers and magazines works primarily for product and name exposure instead of sales. It&#8217;s nice to be able to show potential customers and trade show managers that your product was considered important enough to be featured even by a small portion of your wish list. </p><p>One of the few exceptions to this rule is free coverage in trade publications. This is where you can generate both visual exposure and product sales. That&#8217;s because the audience for trade publications is the very retailers who will be looking to purchase your product <i>in quantity</i>. That&#8217;s a winning combination; so don&#8217;t forget to send media kits to trade publications, even if they seem less glamorous than <i>Vogue </i>or <i>Bon Appetit</i>. </p><p><i>PULLING IT ALL TOGETHER </i></p><p>A good media kit can have a variety of components. When putting them together, think of these kits as your calling card. As such, they are an extended version of the sales tools you learned how to compile in chapter 10, only adapted to fit the more demanding needs of the media. Following are the necessary components for your kits, plus other ideas that may spark your imagination as you and your staff (or media agent) sit down to discuss ideas for your product&#8217;s debut. </p><p><i>YOUR FIRST OPPORTUNITY TO IMPRESS </i></p><p>All good media kits start with a superb folder, envelope, bound notebook, or other imaginative <i>packaging. </i>It can be see-through or conceal its contents. Some are store-bought, while others are handmade&#8212;and some are even hand-stitched! Often this packaging is made of quality paper. We&#8217;ve been excited by the use of fine linen papers, seduced by exotic rice paper or parchments, and especially impressed by the use of various handmade and organic papers. But we have also noted superb ones made of plastic, acrylic, rubber, fabric, and other materials. </p></div><div class="section"><p>The material you use should reflect what your product is all about. </p></div><p>If your product is slick and contemporary, let your media kit packaging </p><p>reflect that attitude. If your item is romantic, use a package that is more elaborate and flowery&#8212;or even seductive. If your product is fun, consider using a little humor from the outside in. </p><p>On the other hand, if you&#8217;re debuting a product in an established, corporate field, use a more elegant presentation with your company&#8217;s name or logo embossed on the outside to announce: &#8220;We have arrived.&#8221; While not completely necessary, having your company&#8217;s name on the outside of the media kit is often a good idea. It helps put your company&#8217;s name in the minds of decision-makers and helps them find your media kit more quickly in a mountain of material. (An excellent resource for personalized folders is an Internet source called Pocket Folder: pocketfolder.com or [800] 842-7751.) </p><p>Whatever packaging you ultimately use, stand back and take a hard look before the media kit goes out the door. It must intrigue the receiver in one of two ways, by visually saying &#8220;interesting&#8221; or &#8220;important.&#8221; If it doesn&#8217;t say either, it&#8217;s not ready to send. </p><p><i>A LOOK INSIDE </i></p><p>The two most important pieces inside your media kit are the news release (also called the media or press release) and your product&#8217;s visual presentation. Let&#8217;s discuss the visuals first, as they often take more time to create. </p><p>For decades, photos were the visual medium of choice, and they still seem to have an edge (though it&#8217;s narrowing quickly). Great pictures are usually those taken by a professional photographer. There: <i>we said it! </i>Lousy or boring pictures are commonplace in media kits, and it&#8217;s usually because they&#8217;ve been taken by someone on the staff of a new or young company. This seldom works. One of us, who studied photography in college and has taken numerous photos for newspapers and magazines, wouldn&#8217;t dare venture into the waters of a professional product photographer! Having worked with numerous photographers on various photo shoots, we know that only a professional can light your product &#8220;just so&#8221; to get the exciting&#8212;and <i>clear&#8212;</i>shot you need to impress editors and producers. </p><p>When interviewing for this important task, make certain your potential photographer brings a portfolio of <i>product </i>shots, not just <i>people </i>shots. (Not all photographers are good at both, and the huge demand </p><p><i>140 </i><i>141 </i></p><div class="section"><p>for portraits means many quality photographers never bother to learn the subtleties of capturing product detail.) </p><p>If you really don&#8217;t think you can afford a pro, consider bartering for the service or hiring the best student photographer from your local community college for a fraction of the cost. However, if you can afford a professional, go for it. It will be money well spent. </p><p>Next, look at the media sources to which you will be submitting photos. Do they always use color photography? Magazines usually do. While newspapers use both, their editors often admit they still prefer to see good ol&#8217; black-and-white photos in press kits. The reason is simple: the paper used to print newspapers is very porous, so often clarity and detail are lost when they try to use a color shot in a black-andwhite photo setting. Therefore, you should make sure your photographer shoots in both formats. </p><p>In recent years many companies have started sending their visual presentations on CDs. Often this option saves time for an editor or a producer. (Photos require the extra step of scanning; CDs don&#8217;t.) Additionally, the clarity is often superior on CDs. </p><p>Almost anyone can burn a CD nowadays. However, we&#8217;ve found a visual aid that can up the ante for your presentations: the die-cut, 4color CD. Though priced slightly higher than plain CDs, they are bound to impress! These CDs can be cut and colored to look exactly like your new product, your company&#8217;s logo, or your media kit&#8217;s theme. The best resource we&#8217;ve found for die-cut CDs is a company called Shape Media, LLC, which claims to be the originator of this concept. To find out more about this slick way to present your visuals, you can contact them at shapecd.com or at (212) 279-2929. </p><p><i>Tell Your Story! </i></p><p>Your news release is an equally important tool. It should be short and sweet, accomplishing everything that needs to be said in one or two pages. Here&#8217;s what your news release should look like. </p><p>Start with these words at the top: &#8220;FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE.&#8221; Next comes an interesting, snappy, or amusing headline. Then begin with a short lead paragraph that is equally intriguing. (See a few examples in our Resource Guide.) At the beginning of this paragraph, note the date of your media release and the city in which your company is based: &#8220;SAN FRANCISCO / 12.11.05:&#8221; or &#8220;WHITE PLAINS, NY&#8212;5/21/2006.&#8221; </p></div><div class="section"><p>Often, headlines and opening paragraphs offer a play on words, as </p></div><p>they relate to your product, a seasonal or holiday approach, or even ask a question. Whatever you use, the goal of your lead paragraph is to make the reader curious enough to read further. </p><p>Your second paragraph should be longer and cover the reason why the reader is holding your media kit: &#8220;This week Ivy League Scholastics, a Massachusetts-based, minority-owned company, released an all-new series of interactive books for children that led to a ten percent advance in test scores of preschoolers during preliminary testing.&#8221; This sample paragraph answers most of a release&#8217;s pertinent questions: who, what, when, where (and sometimes also: why and how). As you finish up your release, it should continue to answer these questions in a bit more detail. A quote from your company president or a reliable outside source is also nice, but only if it enhances the story. Avoid obvious statement quotes such as &#8220;We&#8217;re very excited about our new product.&#8221; They always make the speaker sound foolish. </p><p>As you&#8217;re writing each sentence, remember: it&#8217;s not an advertisement, it&#8217;s a <i>news </i>release. So, be objective&#8212;no cheerleading allowed! </p><p>Finally, give the all-important contact information: &#8220;For more information, additional visuals, or a product sample, please contact [name/phone/fax/e-mail/Web site]. </p><p><i>Other Materials to Consider Including </i></p><p>Sending actual product samples is optional&#8212;and often a bad idea unless the item is small and inexpensive or necessary to explain your product. Under no condition should you ever expect someone from the media to return a sample. Once it&#8217;s out the door, it&#8217;s no longer yours. (However, if you choose to send samples with media kits or with customer presentations, you can take a deduction for them on your company&#8217;s year-end taxes. So keep an accurate list of where and to whom you&#8217;ve sent them.) </p><p>In place of a sample, a fun prop can be an important and memorable addition to your media kit. Our friend Millie Szerman sent out copies of her book about establishing home-based businesses, <i>A View From the Tub </i>(which features Millie on the cover conducting business from her luxurious bathtub), with a small packet of bubble bath in each kit. Years later, editors still remember her book&#8217;s media kit and its bubble-bath prop. <i>Now, that&#8217;s success. </i>On the other hand, the worse prop we&#8217;ve ever used was confetti. It&#8217;s festive and it had a great tie-in to </p><p><i>142 </i><i>143 </i></p><div class="section"><p>a product we were promoting, but a few editors actually called and yelled at us for the mess we created! </p><p>A short (one- or two-paragraph) biography of your product&#8217;s designer and a short overview of your company&#8217;s history can serve as background for media people in a rush to meet a deadline. (A company history is especially effective when courting your local media managers, who might be encouraged by the local angle.) Include both on a single sheet of your letterhead. </p><p>For busy newspaper editors, who must turn out a publication daily, it&#8217;s important to help them visualize other story angles for your product, beyond the &#8220;just released&#8221; aspect. These angles are called <i>story hooks. </i>On a separate letterhead sheet, list a few ideas for their consideration. For example, you might suggest story hooks that appeal to a newspaper&#8217;s business editor (new company or local company angle), their retail editor (new product just hitting local stores angle), and their lifestyle editor (new product as part of an emerging trend angle). Become familiar with each media contact&#8217;s in-house departments and you&#8217;ll see opportunities they might miss simply because they&#8217;re too busy. </p><p>Your follow-up releases to the contacts on your wish list should include a completely new release plus a list of all the noteworthy places your product has appeared: &#8220;Featured recently in <i>People, InStyle, </i>and on <i>The Oprah Winfrey Show.&#8221; </i>A list of important stores where your product is available may also be helpful. If you choose to create these lists, incorporate both on a single sheet of your company&#8217;s letterhead and title it Recent Media &amp; Retail Coverage. </p><p><i>DOS AND DON&#8217;TS </i></p><p><i>Do </i>use your company&#8217;s and product&#8217;s colors whenever possible throughout your presentation. Branding is important. </p><p><i>Do </i>send releases on time. Editors and producers work well in advance. If you don&#8217;t know their specific needs, find out. Never send something too close to their deadline. It likely won&#8217;t make their cut no matter how much they like it. (Note: Sending materials too far in advance is equally bad. Use your good judgment.) </p><p><i>Do </i>send all releases to a specific person, unless you truly cannot come up with a contact name. (Check their Web site first or phone if </p></div><div class="section"><p>that doesn&#8217;t work.) A press kit without a specific name may not get into </p></div><p>the right hands. However, post-9/11, some media sources no longer </p><p>give out names. If that&#8217;s the case, respect the company&#8217;s policy, and inquire instead about the heading you should use in place of a personal name. </p><p><i>Do </i>try to learn the way each media source prefers their news. Most are happy to accept mail. Others like faxes or e-mail (<i>without </i>attachments). Web sites often offer this information. As a last resort, telephone if you simply cannot find this info on your own. </p><p><i>Do </i>follow up, but don&#8217;t nag. Editors and producers are not only busy, they have deadlines to meet. Start a conversation by asking if this is a good time and promising you need only a minute. Be willing to pleasantly accept a no as a no&#8212;at least for now. You can always send another release with a new hook (and updated information) in a few months. <i>Don&#8217;t </i>mess up your next opportunity by being a jerk now. Media managers have sharp memories! </p><p><i>Do </i>consider radio coverage if your product is appropriate for this venue. First ask yourself: how can my product be described over the radio? What appeal will it have for listeners, as opposed to readers and viewers? Surprisingly, many excellent opportunities are missed by product producers who never consider radio&#8217;s vast and diverse audience. </p><p><i>Do </i>write a personal note (on your letterhead) to anyone who helps to get you get free publicity for your new product. Thank them profusely. Tell them how helpful they&#8217;ve been. This is your opportunity to make them feel as good as they made you feel. We once got a phone call from a national magazine&#8217;s publisher/editor-in-chief who laughingly said: &#8220;I&#8217;m calling to thank you for your thank you! It&#8217;s the first one we&#8217;ve ever received . . . and it meant so much to me that I walked it around the editorial room and showed it to everyone.&#8221; Follow-up thank you notes for free publicity should be a no-brainer, but this anecdote attests to the fact that they&#8217;re not! They take just a few minutes of your time but can have long-term effects on the way you and your product are perceived. Remember: you&#8217;re not only showing your product but trying to establish a long-term relationship. </p><p><i>Don&#8217;t </i>forget to send media kits at other important junctures. If you have important personnel news (you&#8217;ve hired a new VP of marketing) or exciting company news (you&#8217;ve just bought out your competitor, or they&#8217;ve agreed to buy your company out for megabucks), it needs to be reported. </p><p><i>144 </i></p><div class="section"><p><i>145 </i></p><p><i>LAUNCH IT! </i><i>MEDIA KIT ADVICE </i></p><p>When making your product introductions, if possible and applicable schedule them around a nationally recognized holiday or month. The media appreciates the time-worthiness of such tie-ins. Send your media kits approximately two weeks prior to a holiday or month&#8217;s starting date for newspapers, television, and radio stations and at least two months in advance to monthly magazines. Here are just a few occasions worth noting. Consumers traditionally spend the most money on those in boldface.

However, if you choose to build your media relations program in-house, there are resources that can put many of these contacts at your fingertips. The best one we&#8217;ve found is Gebbie Press. Since the 1950s, they have specialized in creating lists of the media outlets you&#8217;ll need. Their U.S. media directories (in book or computer program formats) include the following: daily and weekly newspapers (7,000+), television and radio stations (11,000+), and trade and consumer magazines (3,000+). And their prices are surprisingly low. Best of all, Gebbie Press offers a free online service (go to their Web site, gebbieinc.com, and check out the Media Links option on their menu) that allows you to do your own research. However, this takes time&#8212;and time is money. If you use and benefit from their free service, purchasing one of their resources will likely be your next step as you grow your in-house media list. </p><p><i>SUCCESS! </i></p><p>Getting free coverage in a publication or on the air for your new product can be a huge thrill! Further coverage will only enhance this feeling and help validate your hard work. That&#8217;s part of the magic we talked about earlier: every time your company or product is mentioned in a positive light in the media, you&#8217;ll feel great and your product will achieve a new level of success. <i>Savor each moment! </i></p><p><i>146<br/></i></p><div class="section"><p><i>CHAPTER 15 </i></p><p><i>IMPORTANT TERMINOLOGY EXPLANATION: </i>In this book we will use several interchangeable words to describe <i>trade events</i>, including the words &#8220;markets&#8221; and &#8220;trade shows.&#8221; These events generally include both temporary booths on the floor of a convention center or similar building, plus exhibits in permanent showroom buildings, often called <i>market centers</i>. </p><p>At these events companies sell their products (or those they represent if they are sales representatives or importers) at wholesale to other businesses, such as storefront, catalog, and e-commerce retailers. Depending on the type and the scope of the trade event, other types of buyers will be present&#8212;especially at <i>gift shows </i>(also called <i>gift fairs</i>), which, despite their name, cover most nontechnical merchandise categories. At product-specific trade markets (such as food shows, jewelry shows, or toy shows) and in gift markets, you may also be able to sell your products to restaurants, art and craft galleries, museums, corporate gift and party planners, and others who regularly use or retail products. The type of attendees is determined by each market&#8217;s producer. Our list of major trade show companies and trade organizations in the Resource Guide will give you an idea of the scope of events available for your consideration. </p><p>Trade events are almost always closed to the public, though select markets will offer wholesale and retail days during their events. Most trade events offer educational and networking opportunities, as well as the chance to meet customers and potential buyers, get feedback on your products and prices, check out the competition, spot emerging trends or fads, and review display ideas. </p></div><p>Other than creating your products and landing your first big sale, </p><p>nothing is more exciting than going to market (see explanation on the previous page). That&#8217;s where all the players&#8212;big and small, established and brand-new&#8212;gather to court thousands of buyers for that season&#8217;s dollars. It&#8217;s where, aisle after aisle, attendees are entranced with the newest, the biggest, and the best products from manufacturers and artisans who want more than ever to have a successful show and an extraordinary year. It&#8217;s also where we spot the many lines that seem to be struggling, unable to grab buyers&#8217; attention. On the exhibit floor, dreams can be realized or hopes can be dashed&#8212;even though, with some planning, it can become a fairly even playing field. </p><p>So, how does one create the magic that will ensure success instead of mediocrity&#8212;or even failure? </p><p>That&#8217;s the question we&#8217;ll be helping you answer over the next three chapters about trade show success. This first chapter will help you formulate your approach to tackling the vast U.S. marketplace and help you decide where you&#8217;ll need trade show booths or permanent showrooms. The second chapter is about creating trade show booths and product displays that will excite buyers. (We&#8217;ve headed up committees to judge booths in several cities, so we know what works and what doesn&#8217;t.) Finally, there&#8217;s a chapter about what to do <i>before, on site, </i>and <i>after </i>each trade event to ensure a successful event for your company. That chapter includes tips that can help take the headaches out of show planning and participation. </p><p>However, you can&#8217;t have successful shows unless you choose the right ones, so here are our thoughts on choosing the best markets for your line. We&#8217;ll tell you which ones we think you should concentrate on. Obviously our opinions won&#8217;t be popular with everyone. Nonetheless, our goal is to serve you as best we can. </p><p>Wholesale shopping venues have changed dramatically over the past several years. The advice used to be: &#8220;Start in your own backyard and work up to the major shows and showrooms&#8221; or &#8220;Get the kinks out first at your local show, then slowly move forward.&#8221; That&#8217;s never been our advice. We&#8217;re among those who believe it is counterproductive to think small when you have big dreams. Unique products must get on the fast track before other manufacturers start copying them. If you have a great concept and start in a small market, a more established manufacturer will see your product, copy your concept, and bring it to a major market before you get there, causing you to loose sales and credibility. Don&#8217;t make that mistake: be bold with your product&#8217;s </p><p><i>148 </i><i>149 </i></p><div class="section"><p>debut! Hopefully, after reading this book, you&#8217;ll have developed the marketing savvy and the confidence to bring your product to the major shows <i>early </i>so you can get the recognition your product deserves. </p><p><i>TRADE EVENTS VERSUS INTERNET COMMERCE </i></p><p>This is a very pivotal time for trade shows and for permanent showroom buildings. What&#8217;s the problem? Like every other aspect of business, trade shows have been impacted by the Internet and business-to-business (B2B) e-commerce. The growth of electronic transactions between product producers and their customers cannot be ignored. Many retailers are primarily using vendor Web sites to access information, check on the status of existing orders, and find price information. Some are placing orders via the Internet, and that number will continue to grow. This has caused some alarmists to wonder aloud if trade shows will be completely replaced by electronic transactions twenty or fifty years from now. We can&#8217;t say no, but our suspicion is that even that far down the road, trade shows will not only survive, but thrive, though likely in a more condensed format with fewer companies producing them. In the meantime, important alliances have been forged, and future mergers will assure the survival of the fittest trade events, producers, and management teams. </p><p>Alan Steel, executive vice president for George Little Management, which produces the lion&#8217;s share of nonassociation trade events in the United States, including many major gift shows and fairs (see the complete list in our Resource Guide), understands that this is a critical time for all show producers. </p><p>&#8220;The biggest challenge for trade shows is continuing to prove their value in a world of electronic exchange. Face-to-face continues to be the most important means of conducting business,&#8221; Steel said. &#8220;While electronic venues will support the action of shows, going to market will continue to be an essential part of any successful product producer&#8217;s marketing plan.&#8221; </p><p>Wendy Tonkin, vice president of Universal Shows/Western Exhibitors, which partners with George Little Management and powerhouse dmg world media in several U.S. cities, concurs. &#8220;We all know how important it is to make a real connection between the buyers and the product; to give retailers a chance to have the immediate gratification of seeing an item up close&#8212;of being able to touch it and examine </p></div><p>details closely,&#8221; Tonkin explained. &#8220;Electronic ordering is fine for </p><p>known commodities, but it won&#8217;t be the best way to view new lines nor will it teach buyers important skills, such as display techniques. How can buyers get a good sense of the latest trends, newest product colors, and styles if they only shop online?&#8221; Tonkin wonders. </p><p>Indeed, we&#8217;ve also worried that complete online buying might lead to a lack of creativity and product variety in stores, <i>a horrifying thought</i>! </p><p>Most show managers agree that electronic ordering has changed some of their venues. Already, some major manufacturers are showing only their newest and most popular lines at trade shows, instead of their full range of products. They&#8217;re encouraging their regular buyers to access the rest of their extensive collections via catalog, online, or through their sales reps. The day of massive displays that take up huge blocks of real estate on trade show floors may be on the wan, unless, of course, buyers complain loudly and demand to see more product at markets. </p><p>Are you noting a glimmer of hope here? There&#8217;s a big one for new and young companies that simply didn&#8217;t exist ten or twenty years ago when trade shows had major waiting lists for space. Today there&#8217;s a much greater chance you can get into your dream markets due to a certain amount of downsizing by others. How lucky can you be? You&#8217;ve just developed a great new product <i>and </i>you might be able to show it in a major trade show! </p><p><i>ANALYZING YOUR NEEDS </i></p><p>What counts as a major trade show differs a bit, based on industry. However, certain factors are always in place when evaluating where you will do well. Those of you who belong to trade associations should take a long look at any trade event your association produces to see if you want to start with their annual, national show. Some association shows are huge, others small. See if the audience they draw is broad enough for your product&#8217;s introduction and if there are enough buyers attending the market to warrant your participation. </p><p>Another excellent option for many product producers is gift shows. While the word &#8220;gift&#8221; was appropriate when this industry started almost a hundred years ago, it doesn&#8217;t even begin to describe the scope of today&#8217;s gift shows. Though some regional shows remain limited, the huge gift shows in America&#8217;s major trade market cities are filled with an eye-popping array of products. There you will find not only products </p><p><i>150 </i><i>151 </i></p><div class="section"><p>but <i>full divisions </i>dedicated to casual apparel, children&#8217;s products and toys, crafts, design items, garden and patio, gourmet food, furniture, decorative accessories and tabletop, museum store resources, personal care and aromatherapy products, souvenirs and resort items, stationery products and party goods, and much more. (Divisions vary by show; see individual show Web sites for precise information.) Though they may not feature the complete collections that product-specific markets feature, gift shows have become the workhorses of the consumer goods trade show world. The bigger trade shows often feature between 1,500 and 2,500+ booths and buyers from every conceivable type of retail outlet. The biggest American gift shows (also called fairs) will regularly host buyers from most of the fifty U.S. states and U.S. territories, as well as many international buyers. </p><p>The largest gift shows are also in the country&#8217;s most important market cities. The first tier includes New York, Los Angeles, Atlanta, Dallas, and San Francisco. Other important trade market cities include Chicago, Seattle, and Las Vegas. Another city to watch is Orlando, which has become a popular business destination due to its famous leisure attractions. Several other large American cities have solid regional shows, and like the cities above, often host annual (traveling) association markets, as well. In addition to the major gift markets, there are excellent smaller markets devoted to specific product categories. </p><p>In addition to the major gift markets (see our Resource Guide for complete listings), here is a list of some of the other widely known trade shows (which focus on specific product categories), by season: </p><p><i>Winter Markets (January&#8211;March) </i></p><p>American Craft Council Show/Baltimore </p><p>American International Toy Fair/New York </p><p>Expo New York (MJSA, fine jewelry show) </p><p>Fancy Food Show/San Francisco </p><p>International CES (Consumer Electronics Show)/Las Vegas </p><p>International Home &amp; Housewares Show/Chicago </p><p>JA New York (Jewelers of America) </p><p>New York Fashion Week </p><p>Pet Products Trade Show (APPMA)/varies </p><p><i>Spring Markets (April&#8211;June) </i></p><p>All Things Organic Show/Chicago </p><p>Fancy Food Show/Chicago </p></div><div class="section"><p>Gourmet Products Show/Las Vegas </p><p>Incentive Show/New York International Contemporary Furniture Fair/New York International Home Furnishings Show/High Point, NC International New Age Trade Show/Denver National Hardware Show/Las Vegas National Stationery Show/New York Restaurant, Hotel-Motel Show/Chicago </p><p><i>Summer Markets (July&#8211;September) </i></p><p>American Craft Council Show/San Francisco Fancy Foods Show/New York Health &amp; Fitness Business Expo/Denver JA New York (Jewelers of America) Motivation Show/Chicago NeoCon/Chicago (assorted venues, including office and hospitality) New York Fashion Week Variety Merchandise Show/New York </p><p><i>Autumn Markets (primarily October&#8211;November) </i></p><p>EX&#8226;TRACTS/New York (personal care and wellness) International Home Furnishings Show/High Point, NC International Hotel/Motel &amp; Restaurant Show/New York International New Age Trade Show/Orlando Kosherfest/New York New York Gourmet Housewares Show New York Home Textiles Show </p></div><p><i>PERMANENT SHOWROOM BUILDINGS </i></p><p>Not all wholesale shows are produced by associations or independent trade show producers. Some take place in permanent showroom buildings, which house a combination of tenants, including manufacturers, importers, and sales representative organizations. The trade events in these buildings are generally called markets and can include both national and regional formats. </p><p>There are permanent showroom buildings for the apparel, fashion accessory, and jewelry businesses (often these are housed together, though in some cities there are separate buildings dedicated to fine </p><p><i>152 </i><i>153 </i></p><div class="section"><p>jewelry and gems). Other buildings display furniture, home accessories, home textiles, and floor covering. Yet other buildings feature kitchen and bath fixtures, tiles, and architectural products for the interior design and building contractor trades. There are also a sizable number of buildings that showcase gifts, stationery, tabletop, and home goods. Some are also open to the public: most aren&#8217;t. </p><p>As with other categories, the major players in this field are generally in the first-tier market cities of New York, Los Angeles, Atlanta, Dallas, San Francisco, and also Chicago, which is the home of the world-famous Merchandise Mart. For the furniture, decorative accessory, and architectural products markets, High Point, North Carolina, is generally considered the major player. (For a list of some of the showroom buildings in these cities, see the Resource Guide.) </p><p>New York continues to have the widest choice of permanent showroom buildings in the country&#8212;and some of the best wholesale shopping outlets in the world. We asked our own Michael Levinson, a longtime New Yorker, for his thoughts on the permanent showroom scene there. &#8220;New York is the gateway to America, which is the largest consumer market in the world,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;New York can often support any designer&#8217;s entire collection&#8212;be it fashion or home furnishings&#8212;as opposed to the edited versions of a line that might show up in other markets . . . including in a designer&#8217;s own backyard,&#8221; he noted. </p><p>Americans love to spend money. Our bulging closets and garages attest to this. As long as our consumption levels remain strong, there will be no end to the shopping in America&#8217;s many wholesale venues. And while there will always be some exhibitors who struggle or fail at trade events, success stories abound. </p></div><p><i>CHAPTER 16<br/></i></p><div class="section"><p><i>CREATING A GREAT BOOTH </i></p></div><p>In the last chapter you learned about trade shows and how to determine which ones will be right for your company in both the short and the long run. </p><p>In this chapter we&#8217;re going to walk you through all the steps you should take in planning your trade show booth. It&#8217;s easy for us to help you because we&#8217;ve been buyers, exhibitors, and trade show managers, which have allowed us to view booth design from three different perspectives. Over the years we&#8217;ve also headed up the teams that decide which companies get booth and new product awards in various markets and written a brochure about booth design for a major trade show producer. </p><p><i>TRADE SHOW JUNKIES? </i></p><p>We&#8217;ve walked through more shows that we can count, in every major city and every corner of the United States. We&#8217;ve also participated as exhibitors in over a hundred trade shows in almost every conceivable field. While at market, we&#8217;ve experienced the high of having a really big retailer&#8217;s buyer walk into our booth, tell us how much they love what we&#8217;re doing, and hand us that all-important business card with their direct telephone line. <i>(Success!) </i>We&#8217;ve had the pleasure of meeting and starting business with hundreds of independent stores, too. And, over the years, many of these fine buyers have become our friends. </p><div class="section"><p><i>155 </i></p><p>Of course, we&#8217;ve also faced the lows of the trade show experience, such as catching the flu and walking pneumonia while at market. One of us even had to be carted away from a show site in an ambulance after a freak accident involving a punctured can of permanent glue. <i>(Ouch!) </i>We&#8217;ve watched our neighbor&#8217;s poorly executed new booth design tumble to the ground twice during set up, breaking all of their products and leaving them with nothing but brochures to show on opening day. We&#8217;ve sympathized with exhibitors whose freight never arrived. Believe me, we&#8217;ve seen it all! </p><p>Yet, showtime itself is always very special, and seeing the right show with the right audience aligned with the right product is pure magic. That&#8217;s why, despite the occasional illnesses and accidents we&#8217;ve experienced over the years, we truly understand that important adage borrowed from the theater: &#8220;The show must go on!&#8221; The solution to keeping your part of the show up and going throughout the highs and lows is solid planning and a good dose of tenacity. </p><p><i>THE FORMULA FOR SUCCESS </i></p><p>Figures vary slightly, but the basic <i>trade show formula </i>goes something like this: for the average booth with a ten-foot frontage, you have exactly five to ten seconds to grab a trade show attendee&#8217;s attention as they walk by your booth. In that time, they make their decision to stop or move on. </p><p>That may sound a bit scary, but it&#8217;s the reality. Once you accept it, you can start formulating your own plan to stop these attendees in their tracks so they can focus on your product. The easiest way to grab the attention of buyers and other decision-makers at big shows is by doing something truly unique with your space. Here are just a few proven methods for grabbing attention. </p><p>Opt for <i>interesting colors </i>on your walls. Even if you don&#8217;t like neon orange, sunshine yellow, or apple green, consider using them anyway because they may make your booth stand out in an otherwise drab aisle. If bright colors absolutely will not work for your product, consider making a stark, Zen-like statement instead. Some booths we&#8217;ve loved were painted in emerging fashion colors; rich, vibrant, sophisticated shades that seemed new to the eye after a long absence. Whatever you decide, don&#8217;t be afraid to use color. After all, paint isn&#8217;t </p></div><div class="section"><p>permanent. It&#8217;s an inexpensive way to keep your booth looking fresh </p></div><p>and to create a new look from year to year. So check out your color </p><p>sources (see chapter 6) and start playing with paint chips. </p><p>Another proven option is a <i>theme </i>that is carried throughout your booth&#8212;including your staff&#8217;s clothing, if possible. One memorable theme we saw featured a line of dinnerware patterned with scientific equations. The booth&#8217;s props were petrie dishes and lab containers (filled with colored water), which made it look like you were stepping into a mad scientist&#8217;s laboratory. The company&#8217;s owners wore white lab coats. The result was very effective in getting their product&#8212;and their point&#8212;across. Best of all, throughout the show whenever we ran into that company&#8217;s owners in the aisles, their lab coats reminded us of their stunning new line! </p><p>Another booth really excelled in its attention to detail. It featured trompe l&#8217;oeil walls painted to make you think you were in the Rocky Mountains. The company&#8217;s logo was painted above the portrait of a Native American on a horse, also within the wall system of the booth. The flooring was made out of sod (used quite often at shows&#8212;and very comfortable under tired feet.) The line&#8217;s eight products were displayed on pedestals, gallery style. Brochures (tied with twine) were available in the side bags of an old saddle that was propped up in a corner. The staff finished off the theme by dressing entirely in denim. </p><p>Other exhibitors have excelled by using just the right spotlighting (an art), motion, or even scent to stop people in their tracks. A booth we&#8217;ll long remember featured fresh lemon and lime walls plus scent that created a citrus oasis. You could smell the booth all the way up the aisle. It was exhilarating! However, be careful with other, more potent scents, which can be overwhelming for attendees, your staff, and your immediate neighbors. </p><p>Other great booths used <i>displays </i>to grab the eye. One set of props we loved utilized dress forms as bases to show off a new Christmas wreath line. Versions of the wreaths were used as necklaces, belts, and bracelets to finish off each dressed form. Another memorable booth had mannequins dressed as a bride and bridesmaids complete with gowns made entirely out of that company&#8217;s gift wrap. They were show-stoppers! </p><p>The options available for grabbing attention at shows are almost endless. If you can&#8217;t think of something special, enlist your friends and colleagues to come up with ideas. If that fails, enlist the help of a marketing class at a local high school or college (many welcome real-life problems for their students to help solve). Create something special </p><p><i>156 </i><i>157 </i></p><div class="section"><p>and people will talk about it for years. And that impression will translate into brand recognition, respect, and additional sales. </p><p><i>TO SHARE OR NOT TO SHARE? </i></p><p>Some companies prefer to start their climb by doing important trade shows on their own, in the markets they&#8217;ve carefully pinpointed. In addition to making sales, this allows them to get important product feedback, check out the competition, attend seminars for extra training, and find sales reps. </p><p>Others, especially those on extremely tight budgets, try to find sales representatives first (often through correspondence and phone interviews only), then add trade shows to their agenda later. Oftentimes, those manufacturers and artisans never create their own trade show presence, allowing their sales reps to do everything for them. At showtime, they simply arrange (usually for a fee) to feature their products in their sales rep&#8217;s booth. Still others simply opt to be featured in their rep&#8217;s permanent showroom during showtime. This final option might work, but only in trade markets that are showroom-driven as opposed to show-driven. </p><p>To court early success, we firmly believe you should budget as much funding as you can to attend shows in your own booth space. This is the best way to establish your own following in the marketplace. </p><p>If your sales representatives also exhibit in a market where you&#8217;ll be exhibiting, that&#8217;s great&#8212;you&#8217;ll enjoy added exposure for your line! What it really comes down to is that <i>image is everything. </i>Do you really want to ride into the marketplace solely on your sales rep&#8217;s reputation&#8212;or do you understand the importance of establishing your own? </p><p>And there is another issue to consider: is your line easily understood, or is it something that requires a little more explaining and romancing to close the sale? If it needs romancing, you need your own booth because your sales reps will be busy enough in their own booth, selling your line and up to twenty-five others! </p><p>When your representative offers to do a show for you, they may invite you to participate in person or ask you to stay home (due to limited booth space). But beware: even if your sales rep suggests you attend the market, there can be drawbacks. These include very crowded quarters, other companies&#8217; displays vying for attention just inches away </p></div><div class="section"><p>from your line, tension with other manufacturers (&#8220;Excuse me, but </p></div><p>you&#8217;re blocking my display!&#8221;), and so on. If it&#8217;s your only option, go for </p><p>it. However, if you can exhibit on your own, too, you&#8217;ll likely be happier. When you and your sales reps both exhibit in a (major) market, there are benefits for both of you: </p><div class="section"><ol><li>You can get to know your sales reps better. </li><li>There are opportunities to do additional product training. </li><li>You can have one of your sales reps cover your booth at lunchtime or for other short breaks. (Discuss this well in advance of the show so everyone is clear about what can and cannot be done.) </li><li>Your reps will benefit from added business for your product in their territory (for which you will be paying full commission, unless you&#8217;ve worked out another agreement in your initial contract). </li></ol></div><p>We know it seems difficult to shoulder the expenses of your own booth and travel, and then pay your reps a full commission, but it will probably be money well spent. Unless you&#8217;re an evil prima donna, you&#8217;ll walk away from any market you share with newfound respect <i>from </i>your sales reps, and <i>for </i>your sales reps. They&#8217;ll be invigorated by your insights and caring and ready to hit the postshow trail running! </p><p><i>EASY WALL OPTIONS </i></p><p>If you have decided to exhibit in your own booth space, the question becomes: &#8220;How can I do that without going overboard or doing too little?&#8221; </p><p>To find the answer that&#8217;s right for your company, there are several things you should consider. First, having walked through at least one trade show related to your field, you need to think about exactly what others in your business are doing. The answers will vary greatly from industry to industry. For instance, in some fields almost everyone gets away with ordering the standard, bland <i>pipe and drape </i>systems from the designated show decorator. (These are the uniform curtain walls that separate booths and are often provided &#8220;free of charge&#8221; with your prepaid booth package&#8212;if you want them.) We&#8217;ve seen hundreds of pipe and drape booths at various jewelry markets, certain food markets, and </p><p><i>158 </i><i>159 </i></p><div class="section"><p>in a lot of craft shows. However, almost across the board, the trend has been to move up to a <i>more elaborate system. </i>In fact, at many markets, you will find few pipe and drape systems these days. </p><p>If your decision is to create a <i>hard wall </i>booth (or the illusion of one), there are three ways you can go: </p><ol><li>Buy a prefabricated trade show booth from a variety of reliable companies that have showrooms across the United States. </li><li>Hire a builder, or create your own booth system. This allows you a great deal of flexibility in styling. </li><li>Use a nonhard wall material that gives the illusion of a permanent or decorative wall system. One popular material is foam core. (More on foam core momentarily.) </li></ol><p>Occasionally at trade shows, we&#8217;ve seen people use <i>soft wall options </i>that caught our eye because they worked so well. They usually incorporate the use of a quality fabric, which is then attached over the pipe and drape (using pins, brackets, wire, lightweight rods, etc.). Those fabrics almost always match the overall subject matter of the line: bright primary patterns for children&#8217;s lines; velvet or satin as a backdrop for elegant products; sackcloth or hemp for an all-natural line. One manufacturer even created beautiful trailing ribbon walls and then used small electric fans to create a gentle breeze that flowed through the ribbons. (Movement always attracts the eye!) </p><p><i>Inexpensive Walls to Go </i></p><p>Using <i>foam core </i>is another wonderful way to create booth walls and displays on a tight budget. For those of you unfamiliar with this miracle product, it consists of a lightweight layer of hardened foam covered with durable paper. Also known as foam board, it&#8217;s available in a few basic colors, as well as black or white. If you purchase the largest size (4' x 8' panels, often sold in cartons of twenty-five pieces or separately), you can create virtually seamless walls in just minutes. Simply tape the back side, lean them up against the existing pipe system (order it without the drapes), and tape at the top and bottom (using removable tape only). A sharp X-ACTO<sup>&#174; </sup>Knife will help you cut the wall panels with precision and allow you to make display cubes or tables in a snap. (As you cut foam core for displays, remember to stop the knife from going </p></div><div class="section"><p>through that last layer of paper. That way, you can bend the cut edges </p></div><p>(toward you) and create seamless display props that will look like plas</p><p>tic and be almost as durable.) </p><p>There are many positives and negatives to using form core. First, it&#8217;s cheap and reasonably easy to use. (Truly creative people have made wondrous display props with it.) However, it does have its limitations. Due to its paper surfaces, foam core tends to get dirty fast. You&#8217;ll probably have to discard the sheets after one or two shows. Additionally, this material is for decorative purposes only. You can&#8217;t fasten displays or most artwork to this lightweight material. Furthermore, the cartons that foam core comes in often don&#8217;t hold up well, either. If dropped, damage to some of the sheets inside is almost a certainty. </p><p>Over the short run, you might enjoy using this product. However, you can see why we don&#8217;t encourage it as a permanent solution. If you use it, you&#8217;ll likely want to step up to something more substantial after a few shows. </p><p><i>Safety First </i></p><p>With all wall systems that involve fabric or paper products, your walls will have to meet <i>flame retardant standards, </i>which are determined by the local fire marshal and will vary somewhat from market to market. The same standards will apply to any cloth fabric or foam core you use in your displays or on your sales desk. </p><p>It will be <i>your responsibility </i>to make certain these standards are met. Fire marshals have been known to demand the removal of walls that have been tested on-site and failed to meet their department&#8217;s standards. These standards are usually laid out in your official show manual (which arrives once your line has been accepted into a show). Read the instructions carefully, and follow them to a T. Better yet, let a professional treat your walls and displays, and get a certificate indicating that it&#8217;s been done. If you purchase pretreated foam core, make certain you bring your certification to market. The fire marshal may still run a test and charge you for local certification. Just remember, it&#8217;s all in the name of safety! </p><p><i>HARD WALL SYSTEMS </i></p><p>There are two basic styles of hard walls: those that are prefabricated and those that are custom built. Both can offer a lot of pizzazz with the </p><p><i>160 </i><i>161 </i></p><div class="section"><p>right planning. Just remember to always order your booth space without pipe and drape so you won&#8217;t have to wait for someone to come and disassemble it once you get on-site. (Sometimes, it can take <i>hours</i>). </p><p><i>Prefab or Something More Creative? </i></p><p>Even if you don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ll be opting for a prefabricated booth, we suggest you visit one or two showrooms that feature these easy-toassemble options. Years of experience have helped the prefab companies fine-tune their style and method. And many offer enough variations to help you create something that won&#8217;t look like it came from a cookie cutter. Some of these companies specialize in built-in storage, back lighting (especially good for signage), and even pop-up display walls. You&#8217;ll find prefabrication companies in the yellow pages of most cities under the heading &#8220;Displays.&#8221; </p><p><i>Designing Your Own Special Space </i></p><p>If you&#8217;re lucky enough to be able to have a booth built to your own specifications from the start, there are several things you&#8217;ll need to remember. As you will learn from your meetings with prefabrication companies, <i>size </i>is everything. That&#8217;s because booth sizes vary from show to show. Sometimes booths are 10' x 10'. Other times they are 10' x 8'. Usually shows will allow you to have full-size side walls (usually 8' in height). However, other shows will demand that all booths have half-size side walls (though we are finding this less and less). Therefore, if you are planning your own custom booth, preparing for these varying requirements will be important. Your rear wall will likely be 10' at most shows. But those pesky changes in side-wall panels must be addressed as you design your dream booth. One idea is for each side wall to have two 4' panels made, plus one 2' panel that can substitute for a table or display top in shows where it is not needed as a wall. Be creative and you&#8217;re bound to find solutions that will work well for your company. </p><p>Your booth must also fit <i>into </i>the dimensions of the booth space you are renting, so build it slightly smaller (a few inches) in width and depth. This will eliminate a lot of headaches if your booth size has not been calculated accurately by the show decorator, or if an electrical box must be accommodated in your assigned space. (Note: These boxes </p></div><div class="section"><p>often appear on floor plans, so if you see an &#8220;X&#8221; or other marking in </p></div><p>your assigned space, knowing what it is ahead of time can help you </p><p>plan&#8212;or even help you snag an early relocation, if space permits.) </p><p>Develop a <i>wall system </i>that can go up easily without power tools to avoid having to hire extra help on-site (union rules). Generally the rule is that if it takes longer than thirty minutes to put up your walls or if you need power tools, you may be &#8220;asked&#8221; to hire help. Luckily, many hard wall systems have been developed that lock into place. Others require just a few screws. Ask you designer to use an assembly method that will save you time and money in market. </p><p><i>BOOTH ACCESSORIES </i></p><p>Even though shows provide <i>signage </i>with your company name and booth number in easy-to-read block letters, you should design and use your own signage, incorporating your company&#8217;s logo and color instead. It is important to keep your image consistent; after all, that&#8217;s part of branding your name. We also highly recommend that your signs include a <i>tag line </i>right below your company name to quickly tell people what you do. For example: </p><div class="section"><p>ANGELA&#8217;S GOURMET DELIGHTS A taste of heaven right here on earth! </p><p>TOMEKO &amp; COMPANY Furniture Designed with the Future in Mind </p><p>SPRINGFIELD PLASTICWARE Smart Gadgets to Help Anyone Feel Like a Chef! </p><p>SCOTT&#8217;S CAR CARE PRODUCTS<br/>A great shine in no time <br/>at half the price!<br/></p></div><p>You can see from these four examples that buyers will be able to quickly determine each company&#8217;s focus from a few well-chosen words. The above examples talk about superior taste, innovative designing, unique kitchenware, and a product that delivers the goods at half the price. A great tag line is like having another salesperson in your booth who talks to people as they pass your entry. It&#8217;s a real sales enhancer. </p><p><i>162 </i><i>163 </i></p><div class="section"><p>In regards to <i>lighting, </i>think Zen: less is often more. We see too many exhibitors flood their spaces with light (which turns into extra heat in no time at all). Usually, overhead lighting at convention facilities is sufficient basic lighting. Instead, concentrate on spotlights (preferably built in, but attached will do) to draw the eye right to the new products or best sellers you&#8217;re featuring. Some bulbs are nonglare, others, such as halogen bulbs, provide natural light (no yellow tinge), and many bulb choices are even eco-friendly. Only through a bit of testing will you find what works best&#8212;and looks best&#8212;for your needs. </p><p>Many exhibitors who have a custom-designed booth also choose to do a <i>custom floor. </i>In addition to custom carpets, we&#8217;ve seen many interesting materials used: hardwood, hemp, rubber, linoleum, brick, grass, and even leaves. Some contemporary lines opt for the stark cement floors found in most convention centers. Another idea that&#8217;s been popping up lately is the use of product or logo photography, which is then laser-cut right into your floor. Place it at your booth&#8217;s entry for a look that&#8217;s snappy and shouts your company&#8217;s name! </p><p><i>Fixtures, work tables, </i>and <i>seating </i>are areas where you can be as creative or as utilitarian as you want. Start by looking at the designs that are available through display companies. They often have a wide variety of styles to offer. Also consider renting antiques (available in most cities under &#8220;Antiques&#8221; or &#8220;Display&#8221; in the yellow pages) or even recycled furniture or props you find at flea markets or yard sales. A few interesting or brightly painted pieces that work well with your line will help draw buyers&#8217; eyes into your booth. With regards to seating, you can never have too much. Buyers who sit down tend to stay longer. Most inviting of all is the booth sofa, though it can take up a lot of space! Install one in your booth and your booth will become a popular destination for weary buyers who will appreciate your extra care. </p><p>When planning your designs, remember to spend quality time creating a sturdy, reusable <i>shipping crate</i>(s) for your wall system and other booth necessities. Those that open from the side are easier than top loaders. Make certain your logo appears in huge letters on all sides so your shipment can be more easily spotted if delivered to the wrong booth. </p><p>Throughout the initial stages of planning for your custom walls, accessories, and shipping containers, keep two things in mind: as your line grows, you&#8217;ll likely want to expand your exhibit space from one to two or more spaces. Plan for this expansion now. You&#8217;ll also want to re</p></div><div class="section"><p>member how quickly we all tire of a specific look. While you won&#8217;t </p></div><p>want to change your logo or company color on your signage, you may </p><p>want to make other subtle and not-so-subtle changes to your walls and displays after a year or two. If you start designing with that in mind, you won&#8217;t have to do a complete overhaul when you&#8217;re ready for a new look. </p><p>Remember, when your company grows and you have to consider doing more than one trade event at a time, you&#8217;ll need at least two sets of everything. But don&#8217;t roll your eyes. That just means you&#8217;ve moved on to a whole new level of success! </p><p><i>164<br/></i></p><div class="section"><p><i>CHAPTER 17<br/></i></p><p><i>HOW TO OPTIMIZE YOUR MARKETPLACE EXPERIENCE </i></p><p>So, you&#8217;ve come up with a great game plan for your product&#8217;s presentation. Now it&#8217;s time to participate in the vast, competitive world of trade shows. In other words, &#8220;Let the big-time sales begin!&#8221; </p><p><i>WHEN MAKING AN EXTRA EFFORT COUNTS </i></p><p>First, let&#8217;s look at those trade show applications. The forms look pretty straightforward at first glance. However, there&#8217;s more to submitting an application than just completing the required paperwork. Sometimes there are <i>waiting lists </i>for exhibit space at major shows, so it&#8217;s important to position your company in the best possible light. That&#8217;s going to require a little (or a lot) more effort than just following directions. </p><p>Waiting lists are created by show management once they&#8217;ve assigned all exhibitors who are returning to that trade event. (Previous exhibitors always get priority over new lines.) Thereafter, management looks at the spaces remaining on the floor plan and determines which new companies will be considered. If the show is popular and the economy strong, there are many more applicants than spaces&#8212;sometimes dozens or even hundreds more! If that&#8217;s the case, your job is to do whatever&#8217;s necessary to advance up the waiting list. </p><p>So, how do they choose who will exhibit? </p><p>While it may seem more democratic to base assignments on a first-come, first-serve basis, the show producers must consider several factors when assigning the last few spaces. If there&#8217;s already a lot of similar merchandise at the show, it won&#8217;t benefit the exhibitors or the buyers </p></div><p>to feature a repetitive line. Therefore, the companies with the most </p><p>original products and the best booth presentations usually win the coveted opportunity to exhibit. Spotlighting what is truly new and exciting is the show producer&#8217;s job. </p><p>Therefore, when you send in your application, don&#8217;t just throw the requested materials into any envelope. Think <i>emotional connection. </i>Start with a special presentation that romances your line, uses humor, or otherwise sets it apart. Include a line drawing or a photo of your proposed booth setup. Send copies of any recent publicity your company has received. Knowing that your new product has already been featured in a major consumer or a trade publication, or even your regional newspaper, may help sway the choice in your favor. Include photos or publicity about pertinent awards you or your company have won. Tell them about other shows where you&#8217;ve exhibited. If you have a few well-known customers, list them. And if a preshow fee is required, don&#8217;t forget to enclose that. </p><p>Next, write a short note to show management explaining why this show would benefit from featuring your line. Additionally, tell them the drop-dead date on which you can accept a booth assignment for that show, allowing for travel and set-up time. If there are last minute cancellations, they may call you! </p><p>Consider putting all this in an attractive presentation book or folder. We&#8217;ve seen presentations encased in elaborate albums, often costing hundreds of dollars to assemble. Some have utilized expensive background papers and calligraphy. One memorable presentation featured the company&#8217;s name die-cut in a beautiful metal cover. Some presentations arrive lightly scented with an expensive perfume or aromatherapy. Others have tied their presentation with French wire ribbon or raffia and added a sprig of fresh rosemary. For technical lines, some presentations are slick and contemporary. Be creative and allow your presentation to reflect your line&#8217;s attitude. </p><p><i>Important: </i>If you&#8217;re sending a presentation book, attach an extra copy of your brochure or a photo of one of your products to the application to help the show manager easily identify your line in his or her file. </p><p>Finally, if your presentation is expensive and you want it back after the decision is made, include a self-addressed, stamped envelope, box, or delivery service form for this purpose. Don&#8217;t expect show management to pick up this expense. </p><p><i>166 </i><i>167 </i></p><div class="section"><p><i>THE WAITING GAME </i></p><p>Once you submit your application, the waiting begins. Maybe you&#8217;ll be lucky and get accepted right away, but chances are you won&#8217;t get instant acceptance. If the application notes a time frame for acceptance, put that date in your day planner. If you still haven&#8217;t heard by that date, give the show management a quick call to check on your status. But don&#8217;t push. Be polite and cheerful, and ask if they need additional materials from you. Ask when you should call again. If the person who takes your call is very helpful, consider writing a note thanking her for her time and reminding her how much you&#8217;d love to be at her market. Then sit back and wait. </p><p><i>YOU&#8217;RE IN! </i></p><p>Getting accepted into a show is very exciting. You may or may not receive a phone confirmation, followed by your official show exhibitor packet. These are quite thick and will include a lot of loose information sheets and an official <i>exhibitor&#8217;s manual. </i>We cannot stress enough the importance of reading your show materials thoroughly. There will be many forms to fill out and submit, often with prepayments (fees will be higher for equipment orders placed on-site). </p><p>If you are bringing your own hard wall booth system, this is the time to let the show decorator know that you do not want pipe and drape put up in your booth. It will save you valuable time and headaches on-site, since only the show decorator and his or her staff can disassemble the system if it&#8217;s in your way. </p><p>Within your show packet there will also be information on all <i>show events, </i>including seminars on the latest trends in your industry, display ideas, and other tips. These are wonderful opportunities to keep on top of industry issues, upgrade your skills, and network. You may even spot a seminar that can use your product for display purposes. </p><p>Look over the seminar titles carefully and decide now if you want to attend any, as space is often limited. Knowing in advance when you will be away from your booth will also help you and your staff determine how to staff your booth. Some trade shows offer retail store tours, which can be helpful to some manufacturers and artisans who want to know more about a specific city&#8217;s retail scene and possibly </p></div><p>check out potential accounts. Another helpful event for first-time mar</p><p>ket attendees is the official <i>show orientation, </i>which usually takes place at the start of each day. </p><p>Also check your exhibitor packet carefully to see if there is a form to fill out for a new product area. In most shows these are areas set aside to spotlight lines that are new to that market. Being featured there will also help buyers and the press find your booth. </p><p>There are other opportunities to maximize your product&#8217;s exposure. For instance, advertising space is often available in the show directory. Since these directories often end up on buyers&#8217; bookshelves after the show, it&#8217;s a good way to be seen long after the show is over. </p><p>Take a look at the <i>travel and hotel packages </i>put together by the official show travel agent. Their prices are hard to beat! But in order to get the airfare and hotels of your choice, you have to book early. </p><p><i>THE TRAFFIC FLOW GAME </i></p><p>Next, you&#8217;ll want to take a closer look at your booth assignment. Check the floor plan to see where electrical boxes are located. Hopefully, there won&#8217;t be one in your booth. If there is, plan around it&#8212;or see if another space is available (unlikely). </p><p>Then check the all-important aisle traffic patterns. For instance, if your booth is in aisle 4, chances are that much of the traffic will be approaching your booth from the top of the aisle. Odd number aisles generally have traffic starting at the bottom and even aisles at the top. However, if your booth is at the opposite end of the hall, check the pattern from that end, too. Knowing how the traffic is likely to flow will help you determine where to put your newest product or best sellers, where to stand, and how to plan the entry to your booth. It can make a huge difference. </p><p>When ordering supplies from the decorator, your needs will vary by industry. Some attendees will need many electrical outlets, others just a few. If you&#8217;re bringing a fax and a computer, you&#8217;ll need even more &#8220;juice.&#8221; Fewer exhibitors are requesting phone lines these days, but note that cell phones work only sporadically in many convention facilities. And keep your phone conversations to a minimum in your booth, as buyers will be turned off if you are doing business elsewhere when you should be conversing with them. </p><p><i>168 </i><i>169 </i></p><div class="section"><p><i>DEVELOP A SECURITY PLAN </i></p><p>Whatever it takes, you must plan ahead to protect your booth, its contents, your purchase orders, and sales leads because theft and accidents are a reality at busy, competitive trade events. </p><p>You&#8217;ll need to figure out ahead of time where you will store the orders you write at the show and the business cards left with you for follow-up. We suggest a lockbox, clipboards with built-in drawers, or a small safe. Additionally, you&#8217;ll want to take your orders with you each night when you leave. Our good friend Lisa Anderman orders her show purchase forms in triplicate. She hands a copy to the buyer, then takes the other two copies off-site each evening. She packs one copy of that day&#8217;s orders and all business cards in her suitcase, then mails the third set of copies to her office each night. Others fax copies back to their office each day, while others send all orders electronically. Whatever you choose to do, plan ahead. Too many exhibitors lose an entire day&#8217;s (or event&#8217;s!) orders, which translates into lost business and irate customers. You can&#8217;t afford either. </p><p>You&#8217;ll also want to plan ahead for your booth&#8217;s nighttime security at the end of each show day. Even a simple cord drawn across the entrance sends a signal to buyers and exhibitors lingering after hours: <i>Do not enter! </i>It will also help keep the building&#8217;s evening cleanup crew and your competition out of your space. If you are worried about a small prototype, arrange to take it with you each evening or cover it. If you have extremely expensive merchandise that could easily walk away (such as high-end jewelry), it&#8217;s likely that show management will arranged vault space for free or a fee. These arrangements must be made prior to the event. </p><p><i>PREMARKET PUBLICITY </i></p><p>If your budget permits, consider sending product or show logo postcards to retailers from the show&#8217;s region. (Show management may have lists or even address labels for sale or gratis.) The local media often show up for big trade show events, but if you have something truly newsworthy, consider sending them a press kit in advance, marked with the trade event&#8217;s name, dates, and your booth number. Then remember to pack those media kits we discussed in chapters 13 and 14 for the on-site opportunities to court media attendees. </p></div><div class="section"><p><i>Ronco Inventions, LLC </i></p><p><i>Chatsworth, CA/ronco.com </i></p><p><i>A BORN SALESMAN FINDS HIS CALLING SELLING PRODUCTS ON TV </i></p><p>By all accounts, Ron Popeil, creator of the Veg-O-Matic, the Popeil Pocket Fisherman, the Smokeless Ashtray, Mr. Microphone, and numerous other popular inventions, didn&#8217;t truly find himself until he found his calling as a natural-born marketer. </p><p>After a sad childhood in the loveless homes of his parents and grandparents, Popeil still choose to work with his father, inventor Samuel Popeil, helping his dad by demonstrating his wares in Chicago stores in the 1940s and 1950s. One day while taking a break, he noted others directly selling their products on the streets and pocketing large sums of money. He decided to give it a try after realizing, &#8220;I can do what they&#8217;re doing . . . but I can do it better than they can.&#8221; </p><p>Soon Popeil had worked out deals with retailers and was hawking his father&#8217;s and other manufacturers&#8217; products just inside the doors of Wool-worth&#8217;s and other Chicago stores, offering the store managers a 20% cut of the gross. Popeil was quickly making four times what the average American was making. Still, he worried about what would happen if he became ill and couldn&#8217;t keep up the pace of high-powered selling. Intrigued with tele-</p></div><p><i>WHAT YOU SHOULD PACK </i></p><p>In advance of the show, make a list of all the things you need for the show and who&#8217;s responsible for each item. Then, just prior to shipping your goods, double-check to make certain everything has been handled. Avoid the inconvenience&#8212;and expense&#8212;of having to replace something on-site. </p><p>Make sure that whatever you ship to a show site has your company&#8217;s name on it&#8212;especially your machinery, your tool kit, and the items in it. (If you have a special wrench or a screwdriver you must use to assemble your walls, it&#8217;s more likely to get back into your hands when misplaced if it can be identified as belonging to your company.) </p><p>Pack Band-Aid bandages and pain relievers in your tool kit. Even though there&#8217;s a nurse on-site, running to the nurse&#8212;and filling out the paperwork it entails&#8212;takes precious time away from your booth. </p><p><i>170 </i></p><div class="section"><p>vision, he started using that medium for sales in the mid-1950s, promoting the Ronco Spray Gun, a &#8220;garden hose&#8221; with a chamber for holding tablets of soap, wax (for washing cars), weed killer, insecticide, or fertilizer. &#8220;Of course the tablets would run out . . . and I was in the business of selling tablets,&#8221; Popeil explains. He soon became a millionaire, and by the early 1960s began exclusively using television to sell the many products he was developing. </p><p>Popeil&#8217;s business philosophy has helped keep his company on top during the past forty years. &#8220;Other people take the spaghetti approach. They throw a lot of stuff against the wall and hope something sticks. The failure rate is dependent solely on what you&#8217;re throwing,&#8221; he notes. &#8220;I don&#8217;t operate that way. I&#8217;m willing to make a serious investment in an idea and take 2 to 2<sup>1</sup>&#8260;2 years of my life to create it, to get behind it and understand it, and take it to the marketplace.&#8221; </p><p>Popeil&#8217;s drive over the years has been due to much more than just making sales. &#8220;I had finally found a form of affection, and a human connection, through sales,&#8221; Popeil is happy to report. <i>Self </i>magazine&#8217;s readers voted Popeil as &#8220;one of the 25 people who have changed the way we eat, drink, and think about food.&#8221; Now semiretired, Popeil has written an autobiography, <i>The Greatest Salesman of the Century</i>, and continues to produce products that Americans love. </p></div><div class="section"><p>Some exhibitors pack nonperishable food items in their tool kits. (Chocolate, nuts, and granola bars work well as quick pick-me-ups during setup, tear down, and the show.) Others arrive with complete meals packed in a cooler so they don&#8217;t have to stand in long lines for sodas and other basic&#8212;and often expensive&#8212;nourishment during show setup. </p><p>We also encourage exhibitors to watch what they eat and drink at showtime. Fresh breath is a must when you are dealing with customers. So pack enough gum or mints for your staff for the entire event. Some exhibitors also have wrapped candy or mints available for their customers. It&#8217;s nice touch and most appreciated. </p><p>Plan on packing a surplus of these items that exhibitors always run out of: order forms, brochures, price lists, business cards, note pads, and pens, <i>pens, </i>and more PENS! If you have the time and the budget, consider having pens made featuring your company&#8217;s name, tag line,</p></div><p>and contact info. That way you won&#8217;t be nearly as unhappy to see so </p><p>many of them walk away from your booth. </p><p>Of course, the number of brochures and other items needed will vary from market to market. Therefore, always tuck three or more extra sets of your brochures, order forms, and price lists into a folder. That way, if you run out of anything, you can have copies made. (If you can bring them on a disk or CD-ROM, all the better.) </p><p>Two preshow packing tips: try to ship your entire shipment at once. The show decorator will charge an additional fee for each separate shipment. Shipping everything at once can save you hundreds of dollars in expenses. Also, consider shrink-wrapping everything together as one item, and make certain all your boxes are labeled and numbered. And inventory your boxes as they are packed. That way, if something is missing, you can easily identify the gaps when you arrive on-site. </p><p><i>MOVE-IN DAYS </i></p><p>Most shows offer two days for move-in. This involves arriving at the facility and picking up your badges, finding your exhibit space, (hopefully) finding your complete shipment near your exhibit space, and pulling your booth and products together. You&#8217;ll also be dropping off media kits at the press office and product samples for the &#8220;new to show&#8221; display. </p><p>However, all too often move-in glitches can make for a tense day. One or more boxes or crates from your shipment might be missing or delivered to someone else&#8217;s booth. (Alert the loading dock staff, then start looking for it yourself or hope someone else will tell you it&#8217;s in their booth.) Products or displays may arrive broken or damaged. You may decide you need something extra from the decorator&#8212;which can take hours and be much more costly near showtime. If you&#8217;re personally delivering your shipment, you may get stuck waiting in line for hours just to reach the loading dock. It&#8217;s best to plan for these problems by allowing yourself more set-up time than you believe you&#8217;ll actually need (we recommend two days), and then have the luxury of using those hours for other things if setup is a snap. </p><p>If you finish early, walk through the aisles around you to check out the competition and other companies&#8217; displays. If you&#8217;re from out of town, check out the local retail scene in person or by scanning newspa</p><p><i>172 </i><i>173 </i></p><div class="section"><p>per and regional magazine ads. If you see a store that&#8217;s a good match for your product, pick up the phone and invite the owner to stop by your booth. Of course, you can also do what several savvy exhibitors do: turn any remaining time you have into spa time. That way you&#8217;ll be relaxed and ready to go when it&#8217;s officially showtime! </p><p>Last, but not least, consider offering a <i>show special. </i>They can be very effective in closing sales. These generally work in one of two ways: a discount on a product or free shipping on sales over a certain amount (usually higher than your minimum, to encourage larger orders). If you decide to run a special, place small, computer-printed signs on your displays. </p><p>Your show special should be for sales written on-site and for sales discussed there and submitted to your office within a week of the event. It&#8217;s important to offer the extension for buyers who aren&#8217;t authorized to finalize sales. This includes buyers from department stores and other big accounts where the buyer&#8217;s boss&#8212;usually called a <i>merchandise manager</i>&#8212;signs off on all or most of their purchases. </p><p><i>PLAYING BY THE RULES </i></p><p>Showtime finally arrives and the air is filled with excitement. For some companies, this is make-it or break-it time, so be thankful you&#8217;ve planned ahead. </p><p>There are some important trade show rules to remember that apply to most markets. Ignore them and you might not be invited back! </p><p>Most importantly, remember that you can only solicit business from the confines of your booth. Period! No one from your company can stand in the aisle to encourage people to stop in, nor can brochures or other enticements be handed out anywhere else on the show site. It simply isn&#8217;t fair to other exhibitors. Your bold booth display, your product, a nice smile, and warm hello should be all you need to encourage buyers to stop in and check things out. Occasionally we see exhibitors handing out free samples or premiums to passersby. If you plan on doing this, your feet must be firmly planted inside your booth. Better yet, clear promotional product handouts with show management ahead of time. </p><p>If you have accidentally left signage behind in your office, do not make a handmade sign. This is a professional show. Act accordingly. </p></div><div class="section"><p>Be aware of your booth&#8217;s neighbors and their needs. If you plan to </p></div><p>play music in your booth, keep the volume low. And don&#8217;t over-use </p><p>scent or potpourri in your display. It may make others sick. Make friends, not enemies who might complain to management. </p><p>Try not to eat lunch in your booth. However, if you do, push your lunch out of sight whenever someone enters your booth. Buyers will seldom bother exhibitors who are eating, so don&#8217;t let a little food get in the way of possible sales. And it should go without saying: unless you&#8217;re a food exhibitor, don&#8217;t cook food in your booth. It&#8217;s a major fire hazard. </p><p>Another complaint from show managers is exhibitors who arrive carrying a newspaper or a book. Showtime is not the time to catch up on your reading, even if traffic is slow. It sends an unprofessional message, so don&#8217;t do it. </p><p>Don&#8217;t start packing your products up early. We have walked through many shows where some exhibitors start tearing down their booths one or two hours prior to the market&#8217;s closing time. This isn&#8217;t fair to the buyers who remain, to your neighbors, or to show management. </p><p>Speaking of show management, extend an invitation for them to stop by and see your line up close. If you&#8217;ve done a particularly good job with your booth display, this is a great way for them to remember who you are and what your company does. And your professional display and courtesy will make getting into their other markets easier. However, don&#8217;t offer them products or gifts, which might be interpreted as bribes. For show professionals, hearing praise about their show is the only thanks they need. </p><p><i>A FEW RULES OF YOUR OWN </i></p><p>Train those who work in your booth to do the following: </p><p>Check every badge as an attendee enters your booth. Is this person a buyer? <i>Excellent! </i>Is he or she a member of the press? <i>Great! </i>Is this another exhibitor or a show guest? If the answer is yes, you need to find out why he or she stopped by. Show protocol dictates that they should-n&#8217;t be in your booth unless invited. In that case gently find out what they are doing there, and if you are uncomfortable about it, politely ask them to leave. (You&#8217;ll learn that some attendees hide their badges. Sometimes it&#8217;s because they are an important buyer, but not always. Ask if you don&#8217;t see a badge. You have the right to know who&#8217;s in your booth.) </p><p><i>174 </i><i>175 </i></p><div class="section"><p>Even if you are very busy, make a point to warmly greet every person who enters your booth. A simple &#8220;Good morning!&#8221; or &#8220;Hello, I&#8217;ll be with you next!&#8221; is sufficient. </p><p>If you&#8217;re casually conversing with a colleague when someone enters the booth, end the chatter. Attendees are leery about breaking into a conversation. Don&#8217;t make them ask for your attention. But also give them some space if they&#8217;re &#8220;just looking.&#8221; If they really admire a product, start a conversation, such as: &#8220;That&#8217;s one of our best sellers/our newest items . . .&#8221; It can go a long way to opening the door to further conversation and new business. </p><p>Make a firm company rule: for every brochure you give out, collect a business card. Some buyers run out of cards, so have a book they can sign. This information will be helpful down the road as you build your mailing list. Perhaps the buyer would also like to be placed on your e-mail list? (Important to note, since it may soon be regulated, requiring permission.) If possible, list what product(s) the retailer is most interested in purchasing on the back of the business card with any other instructions. You&#8217;ll be collecting dozens or even hundreds of business cards at each show, so notes on the back will give you and your sales staff specific directions on how to handle each buyer. </p><p>Needless to say, make certain someone is always covering your booth. If you are truly alone, perhaps you can work out something with a neighboring exhibitor to cover your booth for a few minutes during the day. But otherwise plan on being there for the duration of the show. If it&#8217;s a slow day, you may feel like walking a few aisles, but believe us, that&#8217;s exactly when the big buyers or a member of show management will stop in to see you. It&#8217;s very unprofessional&#8212;and just plain crazy&#8212;to take the chance that no one from your team will be in your booth for those special moments. </p><p>Sales representatives looking for lines may also call on you. It is best not to make any decisions regarding representation on-site. In fact, before you hire (or replace) anyone, we suggest you read our comments on sales representation in chapter 19. </p><p>Hopefully you&#8217;ll be happy with your show location. However, you might spot a show division that&#8217;s a better match for your line. If so, request it next time. Just know that it can take more than one show to gain the seniority to move to the spot you deem best. </p></div><p><i>IT&#8217;S NOT OVER YET </i></p><p>Many people think of tear-down time as the end of the market. <i>Far from it! </i>In many ways, it&#8217;s just the beginning. </p><p>You will have been visited by many buyers who took brochures and showed interest but didn&#8217;t write business with you. Postshow is the ideal time to court them while your line is still fresh in their minds. Yet many exhibitors have lousy follow-through. Our guess is that over half of exhibitors miss this important step. Don&#8217;t be one of them! </p><p>Hopefully you&#8217;ve also benefited from attendee feedback. Were your colors and patterns well accepted or not? Did several people say your prices were too high or that they wished you&#8217;d make an adjustment to a product? Note comments that you heard more than once on paper now and promptly discuss them when you return to your office. </p><p>Pack your boxes carefully and make certain each separate box or crate is numbered. Remember to fill out all forms and labels completely in clear handwriting and place them on each box, crate, or shrink-wrapped pallet. To save time on-site, consider bringing preprinted return labels with you to market. </p><p>Don&#8217;t forget to turn in your <i>bill of lading </i>(which gives the specifics of your shipment) at the appropriate show desk. Are you using the show&#8217;s specified shipper or your own? Using the one show management has chosen will likely save you money. </p><p>If your products are going to another show produced by the same company, there might be a <i>caravan shipment </i>you can join that will cost even less and make your shipment a priority at the next market. Caravan forms are generally found in show manuals. Sometimes you can also order this service on-site, but they often have to turn exhibitors away. Be an early bird and save money! </p><p>Now you can leave the show site confident that you&#8217;ve done everything possible both before the show and on-site to help achieve maximum exposure and sales. Whether you have good follow-through is truly up to you. We suggest following up sales leads and giving contacts to your sales reps within that first postshow week. Much later than that and you risk missing some golden opportunities. </p><p><i>176 </i></p><div class="section"><p><i>CHAPTER 18 </i></p><p>This chapter will make you more comfortable when you visit new cities and also help you plan what to pack for an important business trip to a major trade event. For instance, should you pack an umbrella or a jacket for a summer trade show or convention in San Francisco? The answer is a light jacket. An umbrella is never needed in the City by the Bay during the summer months; yet people often freeze because they fail to pack for the springlike summer weather. </p><p>Can you expect daily rain in Miami during the morning or the afternoon? That depends on whether you are at working at the trade centers near the airport or at the convention centers in Miami and nearby Miami Beach. It rains at the beach in the morning hours and at the airport and trade centers (nine miles away) during the afternoon on most summer days. </p><p><i>GENERAL THOUGHTS ON WHAT TO PACK </i></p><p>Regarding appropriate clothing for U.S. markets, there are a few firm rules. </p><p>Just because the retailers are showing up in shorts and sneakers doesn&#8217;t mean you should. Exhibitors are expected to help set the dress standards at each market. This means dressing up without overdressing. You don&#8217;t want to dress too casually, but if you dress too formally, you may make buyers feel uncomfortable. Unless you&#8217;re in a major market city in the northeastern United States (New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C.), you can forget the tie, guys! Sports </p></div><p>jackets and sweaters will be acceptable. For women, dresses and suits </p><p>are always appropriate. Retailers in warmer climates such as Miami, Orlando, and Los Angeles tend to dress very casually, so you can be a bit less formal, too. </p><p>Of course, if the line you&#8217;re showing is casual clothing, you can wear your line to help promote it. In various other markets (food shows or other markets where demonstrations rule) aprons are often part of the exhibitor uniform. Additionally, on move-out days (the last day of each show) you can usually get away with less formality. </p><p>If you are walking a show as a guest (to evaluate the market for future participation), you should always dress up. You&#8217;ll be evaluating the show, and show management will also be evaluating you when you pick up your badge and show information. Look your best! </p><p><i>MARKET CITY INFORMATION </i></p><p>With a little help from our favorite weather source, <i>Places Rated Almanac, </i>plus information pulled from the most recent census adjustments and various city and airport Web sites, here&#8217;s a quick overview of the cities you&#8217;re most likely to visit for a major trade show or industry convention. </p><p>Note that under <i>Basic Facts, </i>we list entertainment options beyond major sports teams, art museums, botanical gardens, and zoos. Under <i>Transportation, </i>rates listed are based on prices at the time of our research and may be subject to increases.

The stationery market was at its all-time high of popularity, bustling with energy and interesting new designs. The greeting card and gift lines she also represented were those coming out of the design district of Milan and from America&#8217;s trend centers, New York and California. It was not uncommon for her to hear <i>WOW! </i>every time she showed something new to her customers. It was a wonderful time to be a sales rep! </p><div class="section"><p>Fast forward about twenty years, and the scene is <i>completely </i>different. </p></div><p>Today being a sales representative isn&#8217;t as much fun. Courting retailers and keeping manufacturers happy is very, <i>very </i>hard work&#8212;and, for some, becoming more difficult with each passing year. Like the trade show industry, sales reps have been making adjustments to high-tech advances that allow buyers to order directly online. But unlike trade show companies, which are weathering these changes, the plight of many sales rep agencies has been extreme. In some cases retailers have forgotten the consequences that direct ordering often has on their loyal sales reps, including a reduction in commissions for many reps. To make matters worse, it&#8217;s happening as reps are dealing with increased expenses on the road, where so many of their sales are made. </p><p>We were shocked when we picked up the telephone to interview owners of several outstanding sales rep agencies we&#8217;ve admired, only to find that many had either closed down or changed dramatically. Many simply gave up after years in business, or decided to put their energies and talents to better use elsewhere. Others have survived but have </p><div class="section"><p><i>191 </i></p><p>downsized, leaving their permanent showroom spaces for warehouse space or home offices. Some were still in business but had diversified. All had felt the pinch of the Internet. Those remaining are particularly resilient agencies with owners who still love what they do: selling product and acting as intermediaries between manufacturers and retailers&#8212; often building personal relationships with store owners and buyers that manufacturers simply can&#8217;t match. However, the agencies that are healthy seem to be the exception. </p><p>Today it appears that the way manufacturers deal with reps and reps deal with their manufacturers has gone through a major shake-up. Understanding this will be paramount to your business dealings with reps and with buyers. </p><p>Ted Watson sold his popular sales rep agency and showroom in 2002, and is now concentrating his efforts on his two superb Seattle stores, Watson Kennedy Fine Living and Watson Kennedy Fine Home. He chose to leave the sales rep field for the more creative outlet that retailing offers. </p><p>Watson noted that one of the frustrating aspects of being a sales rep was helping innovative young companies get up and rolling, only to have them move on when they felt the lure of a bigger showroom with a larger staff. </p><p>&#8220;The repping end of the business has become very challenging,&#8221; said Watson. &#8220;It takes a lot of work to have a showroom, do shows, and show product (on the road). You can give a retailer a catalog one day and if the retailer gives the order directly to the manufacturer the next day, you can be out of a commission completely or get a split (half) commission.&#8221; </p><p>Watson noted that the commission reps get depends on the contract established with the manufacturer and on that manufacturer&#8217;s honesty: &#8220;For small, specialized showrooms featuring a lot of artists and smaller companies, it&#8217;s a lot harder than it is for those companies featuring a major line.&#8221; </p><p>As a manufacturer, you&#8217;ll need to understand the concerns and issues of these hard-working people when you start interviewing them about the possibility of representing your line within their territory. </p><p>First, however, let&#8217;s look at your company&#8217;s needs. You&#8217;re now about ready to show your new product to retailers around the country. Meanwhile, you still likely have a limited in-house staff, so you&#8217;ll need assistance. You could build an in-house sales team, but that takes a </p></div><div class="section"><p>great deal of time and money&#8212;often with mixed results. It&#8217;s usually </p></div><p>better to hire sales rep agencies that know the geography and the re</p><p>tailers. </p><p>In addition to branding your line through your own efforts, you&#8217;ll likely need more support to blanket the country with your new product quickly. Where do you turn to do that? </p><p><i>TYPES OF SALES HELP </i></p><p>The type of line you are developing and the type of representation required by the stores you will be targeting will be your main determinants when choosing a sales rep agency. </p><p>Most small lines require traditional sales reps. These reps&#8217; customers are more varied and include independent retail stores, small chains, catalogs, museums, retail e-commerce sites, and some larger accounts. Their responsibilities include meeting with potential and established customers for your product at shows, in showrooms, and on the road. Due to increasing expenses, many now also conduct a fair amount of business by phone or e-mail. They will write orders, handle problems for you or the retailer, make display suggestions, and occasionally do light inventorying. But they won&#8217;t purchase or warehouse your line. Today many reps carry a laptop at all times so they can check the status of an order, get real-time inventory levels, and instantly place orders. </p><p>The number of lines traditional reps carry varies. If they already represent one or two big lines, they won&#8217;t carry many other products. Some reps prefer to work with interesting young manufacturers and artisans. They often tend to have trendy products and more of a creative edge to their businesses, yet they must carry more lines out of necessity. </p><p>Meanwhile, if you&#8217;ve developed a new line of products most likely to end up on the shelves of grocery or drug stores, big box, or other mass retailers, you may need the services of a <i>distributor </i>instead. A distributor is a sales representative, <i>plus </i>a service provider and a depository for your product. Distribution companies often focus on specific types of retailers or types of products. Some specialize in toys or personal care items or food, for example. Distributors will charge more for their additional services. Anticipate and build as much of this cost into your price points before you meet with them or with a major retailer. </p><p>Initially, a distributor may agree to show your product before making a firm commitment. They&#8217;ll show it to the regional or national re</p><p><i>192 </i><i>193 </i></p><div class="section"><p>tailers with whom they work. If the retailer agrees to add your product to their inventory, the distributor is the one who places the actual order with you and becomes your customer. Most of the stores they work with have inventory and display set-up needs at each store location, and the distributor will hire people to handle these as well. If you look closely when you shop, you&#8217;ll often see distributors&#8217; employees in stores, setting up cardboard or end-cap (aisle-end) displays and putting stock on shelves or on wall displays. They generally warehouse a predetermined amount of your product and pull orders for their retailers from that stock. Your company will be alerted when the stock reaches a certain level, and you&#8217;ll be expected to ship more immediately. </p><p>Sometimes you don&#8217;t get to choose your own distributor. One of us went through the process recently while helping a client. We were able to get through the layers of contacts to get to a big box buyer. She liked the product but immediately asked for some minor packaging changes and then agreed to do a blind test market at several of their stores around the country. (Manufacturers are usually expected to pick up the cost of these tests, which can run several thousand dollars.) After the blind test, the next step is to find a suitable distributor from the retailer&#8217;s preferred distributors list. (So, when working with huge accounts, your choice of representation might actually be someone else&#8217;s choice!) </p><p>Working with a distributor can be wonderful for companies that already have a strong business and many accounts. However, these relationships can be problematic, too. Manufacturers seldom have a real sense of how the buyers and store managers really feel about their line because there are layers of people working with each product. The loyalty factor may also be lower: lines can easily be replaced by another product a distributor carries, leaving a manufacturer with excess stock. </p><p><i>APPLYING THE GOLDEN RULE </i></p><p>For this and other reasons, we believe most of you will be starting&#8212; and perhaps staying &#8212;with regular sales reps where the working relationships are usually much closer than with distributors. We suggest going one step further: treat them like family. They&#8217;re out there showing your product each day, so don&#8217;t penalize them when a retailer calls in an order on your toll-free line or places an order online. These retailers likely know about your product due to your rep&#8217;s help. </p></div><div class="section"><p>And pay them on time! Many manufacturers treat their sales reps </p></div><p>like banks, holding back their pay for weeks (or months) when cash flow is low. This is not acceptable behavior, and it can easily give a manufacturer an extremely bad reputation&#8212;not only locally, but nationally. So pay your reps <i>first</i>, not last! </p><p>While some reps often have legitimate complaints about their manufacturers, more are starting to complain about retailers within their territories, too. </p><p>One rep we spoke with sharply criticized the many retailers who go directly to the manufacturer. &#8220;Customers who think they&#8217;re working with the manufacturer are fooling themselves,&#8221; this rep insists. &#8220;When retailers bypass reps, all parties have a lot to lose because a </p><div class="section"><p><i>555 International, Inc. </i></p><p><i>Chicago, IL/555.com </i></p><p><i>THE LOVE OF CUSTOMIZATION HELPS AN <br/>INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER FIND HIS NICHE<br/></i></p><p>Not all companies have the goal of selling thousands of an item. For these specialists, customization allows them to create just a hundred, or a couple of dozen, or even just a single product in any given style before moving on to the next big project. </p><p>One such company is 555 International, Inc., a design fabrication firm that makes retail, restaurant, sports arena, and hotel environments, building them from the concept up and manufacturing the furniture, lighting, and displays along the way. 555 International was founded in 1988 by James Geier (yes, he is related to one of our writers), who created a core line of contemporary furnishings that can be sold at retail, with an emphasis on unique, specialty pieces. </p><p>Geier created his design consultancy and its manufacturing arm to help fill a void. &#8220;I saw a niche in the marketplace that was being under-served, a need nobody was filling. I had expertise, experience, and my love of design and art. I realized that manufacturing and environments could be applied to make a real living,&#8221; explains Geier, noting his passion for the field. Today Geier and over a hundred of his employees make a living in this high-energy arena. </p><p>Since the company started, its focus has altered a bit. The original plan was to produce furniture and home accessories for retail sale and for fash</p></div><div class="section"><p><i>195 </i></p><p>good rep is like a consultant, too. They can alert both manufacturers and retailers to what trends they see coming down the road because they&#8217;re in and out of so many stores and see so much,&#8221; she pointed out. Working with a rep also assures the manufacturer and the retailer that the products won&#8217;t end up in a competing store around the corner&#8212;or next door. &#8220;Manufacturers and retailers need to remember that our business is like a triangle: one side is the retailer, another the product producer, and the other the sales rep. If one side is lopsided and out of balance, everyone loses,&#8221; she explained. </p><p>Another rep we interviewed compared manufacturers and retailers who work around reps to a spouse having an affair. &#8220;Why would they do that to me after all the loyalty I&#8217;ve shown?&#8221; she questioned, her </p><p>ion retail environments. Now, due to demand for the company&#8217;s furniture and style, the company concentrates on creating complete environments that often look more like movie sets than entertainment and retail spaces. </p><p>But even though the scope of clients has grown, the focus has gotten narrower in another regard. &#8220;It&#8217;s now completely high-end,&#8221; notes Geier, explaining that more clients want custom products to help them stand apart&#8212;and want Geier and his team to push the creative envelope. The results are all very different, with one goal in mind: &#8220;Environments helps sell the products. Furniture, lighting, fixtures, signage, graphics, and architectural elements are the products we create and sell to help maximize the client&#8217;s retail sales.&#8221; </p><p>Over the years, 555 International&#8217;s clients list has started reading like a Who&#8217;s Who of the retail and entertainment fields. Clients include retailers A/X Armani Exchange and Emproio Armani, Gucci, Polo, DKNY, Fred Segal, Yves St. Laurent, Levi Concept Shop, and North Face; and entertainment venues such as the NBA Shop, Green Bay Packers, the Palms Hotel &amp; Resort, plus the Ghost Bar and &#8216;9&#8217; restaurants in Chicago, Las Vegas, and California. </p><p>When did Geier know his business would be a success? &#8220;I never did, nor do I think of it in that way. I always know that I need to work constantly to stay ahead of the competition.&#8221; Still, Geier and his team thrive on each new challenge and the success that comes from pursuing it. </p><p>His advice to you is the same advice he gives his team: &#8220;Be ready, because the competition is <i>always </i>ready.&#8221; </p></div><p>agony clearly noticeable. It&#8217;s a question you must ask yourself while </p><p>standing in the rep&#8217;s shoes. </p><p><i>FINDING QUALITY REPS </i></p><p>If you have a great-looking booth at a trade show, chances are sales reps will find you. Look for high levels of enthusiasm for your product. If they love it, chances are their customers will, too. </p><p>If they have a booth or a showroom, visit it and check out their other lines to see if they&#8217;re a good complement to yours without being in direct competition. Look at the way they display products to see if they are skilled in this important area. Meet their team members and observe how they work with customers. Do they have a good sales pitch and seem genuine with customers? Does their level of professionalism match or exceed yours? Whether they have a booth or a showroom for you to review, ask for references. These should include three manufacturers and three retailers. </p><p>If you begin your rep search in the off-season, consider visiting the permanent showroom buildings in the region where you&#8217;re seeking coverage. Call ahead and talk to their marketing directors. Ask which showrooms have lines similar to yours. Next, call all of their recommendations for an initial phone interview. Eliminate a few and make appointments, or send materials if you simply cannot afford to meet in person. (We highly recommend face-to-face meetings.) You can also take out a help-wanted advertisement in trade publications, but be prepared for a lot of calls unless you are very specific and say &#8220;experienced only.&#8221; </p><p>Beginning with the first interview, it&#8217;s important for both parties to be honest with each other. As a manufacturer, you must be clear about your hopes and expectations. However, as someone introducing a single product or a small line, you can&#8217;t expect to be treated like a star. Good reps will fit your product into their presentations. Know that due to time limitations, they may not be able to show your line during each sales call. Their biggest moneymakers are shown first. Other products are shown as often as possible, based on the tastes of the buyer. </p><p>Sales rep agency owners need to be straightforward with you as well. Sometimes a rep will take on a line simply to have something new to show. Once the newness wears off, they&#8217;re on to something else. Taking on a line for the short term does a disservice to all parties. </p><p><i>196 </i><i>197 </i></p></div><div><div class="section"><p>Therefore, both parties must judge each other&#8217;s enthusiasm level and be specific about expectations. Don&#8217;t settle: make certain both parties are in it for the long run. </p><p><i>SALES CONTRACTS </i></p><p>In all cases, sign a contract with your new sales rep agency. Many agencies have ready-made ones. If so, make certain it benefits both parties. You can also establish your own contract by using any of the ready-made ones found on various Web sites. StartUPbiz.com has templates that may fit your needs. Sales associations you join may also offer these forms. A contract doesn&#8217;t have to be complicated, just something that spells out territory size, commission rate (which varies widely by industry), terms of payment, payment for samples for the showroom and reps (usually paid by the manufacturer, who also refreshes samples after normal wear and tear), plus a termination clause. Generally, if either party wants to end the relationship, sales representatives are given one month to finish pending business, unless both parties agree to sever earlier. Samples are returned upon payment of the last commission. </p><p>Depending on your product, there is one addition you may need to your contract. It&#8217;s called a secrecy or a non-disclosure clause. If you have design or formula secrets that your sales reps will be privy to, you should sign the general contract with the agency and sign a nondisclosure agreement with each sales rep. (Secrecy-agreement templates can also be found online, or ask your lawyer if you have specific concerns.) </p><p><i>A FINAL WORD </i></p><p>Once you&#8217;ve hired a good rep and trained his or her staff (in person, if possible), let them do their job. You&#8217;ve hired a pro. Let them spend their time working with customers. Weekly reports are fine at first. Then they should become biweekly. Work out a system that&#8217;s comfortable for you and the owner of the sales agency. </p><p>In all cases remember to treat the sales reps well. When warranted, write notes of congratulations on a job well done. Run regular incentive programs for them, such as which rep within an organization, or </p></div><div class="section"><p>nationally, can sell the most products in a month. (We highly recom</p></div><p>mend an incentive program to kick off your business with a new organ</p><p>ization. It&#8217;s a great learning and motivational tool.) Offer a cash prize or a gift certificate to the winner, congratulating him or her personally and publicly (i.e., in your newsletter or on your home page). Take all your reps out to breakfast, lunch, or dinner when you visit their region. It doesn&#8217;t have to be expensive&#8212;try someplace fun if you&#8217;re on a budget. Remember their birthdays, holidays, and the names of their spouses and children. After all, they&#8217;re family now! </p><p>Of course, they have responsibilities, too. Your reps should be your ears and eyes to their local marketplace&#8212;especially if they&#8217;re in a major trend center and you&#8217;re not. Just as they consult with their retailers, they should also provide news and ideas to you. You&#8217;ll value their feedback, which is usually based on their customers&#8217; comments. Don&#8217;t go on the defensive when, from time to time, it&#8217;s not what you want to hear. </p><p>Additionally, if you hire a sales agency and your sales drop off, don&#8217;t always assume it is the sales reps&#8217; fault. Reps have complained to us that they try to tell their manufacturers when a piece is past its prime or has saturated its market, but often the manufacturer isn&#8217;t listening. If you hear the same complaint from several sales reps, you likely have a <i>product </i>problem, not a <i>rep </i>problem! Find out what they think you should do to attempt to fix the problem. (Sometimes a sale or a color change will help; other times you should phase out the item.) Let your reps help you decide how to redirect your business. Don&#8217;t be afraid to hear that it&#8217;s time for new items. That&#8217;s part of the cycle. Few products have real longevity. </p><p>You&#8217;re all likely to experience ups and downs together&#8212;hopefully as a cohesive team. There will be times when you&#8217;re going to be frustrated with your reps and other times when you&#8217;ll want to kiss the ground they walk on. </p><p>So speak, but also listen carefully when you talk to your reps. It must be a two-way conversation, shared by people with mutual respect and common goals. Weather the cycles of ups and downs together, without blame on either side. That&#8217;s how success is built for the long term. </p><p><i>198 </i></p><div class="section"><p><i>CHAPTER 20<br/></i></p><p><i>TO GIVE YOU THE EDGE AND INCREASE YOUR SALES </i></p><p>While it might be nice to find all the business you need through your own efforts or those of your sales team, you should also learn to rely on additional channels to find new accounts and generate reorders. Unfortunately, most manufacturers and artisans don&#8217;t know about the many companies and organizations that produce tools that can help you accelerate your sales goals. Here are some of them. </p><p><i>RESOURCES TO DIRECT YOUR EFFORTS </i></p><p>Did you know that several companies publish detailed directories of the types of retailers you may want to court? Their regularly updated books list pertinent information on thousands of major U.S. retailers, which usually includes exact company names, addresses, contact numbers, Web sites, gross revenue, expected profit per square foot, plus the names of executives, divisional merchandise managers, and buyers (including the departments they buy for). A few guides even specialize in independent stores. </p><p>While these resources are very economical, considering their content, they aren&#8217;t inexpensive. We suggest you review all of these directory suppliers to find the best titles for your specific business. </p><p>The largest directory source is Lebhar-Friedman, Inc.&#8217;s <i>Chain Store Guide </i>(CSG<sup>&#174;</sup>) at (813) 627-6800 and csgis.com. Whether your new product fits into the consumer goods, consumer electronic, restaurant, automotive, marine, or discount marketplace, they likely have a guide or two to help you locate core retailers across the country. Many of </p></div><p>their guides are available in four formats: book, CD-ROM, online </p><p>&#8220;pro,&#8221; or online &#8220;lite.&#8221; They offer discounts for those who purchase a directory along with its CD-ROM or online companion. </p><p>CSG offers personnel databases in several categories and will even customize a database and mailing labels to match your company&#8217;s specific needs. Additionally, they offer specialized studies, including the <i>Top 50 Hispanic Markets Report </i>and the <i>Kmart-Sears Merger Intelligence Report, </i>which can help companies navigate changes within the corporate and buying structures of that retail giant. </p><p>Another excellent supplier is Douglas Publications Inc. at (804) 762-9600 and douglaspublications.com. Most of their directories are available alone or in a combination directory/CD-ROM set, which allows you to use its data system with your own. We like their Web site option that allows potential buyers to read about their studies in-depth and view sample listings. Some of their directories cover Canadian retailers, too. Douglas Publications offers a smaller selection of directories, specializing in select consumer goods markets. Some of their titles are <i>Gift, Housewares &amp; Home Textile Buyers, Women&#8217;s &amp; Children&#8217;s Wear Buyers, Men&#8217;s &amp; Boys&#8217; Wear Buyers, Mass Merchandisers &amp; Off-Price Buyers, </i>and <i>Corporate Gift Buyers</i>. </p><p>A newer source of information for apparel, fashion accessory, and jewelry manufacturers and artisans is Infomat, Inc. at infomat.com and </p><p>(212) 398-5505. Their guides are broken into smaller market segments such as umbrellas, baby accessories, small leather goods, blazers, loungewear and robes, and dozens of other categories. Multipurpose, their guides can put you in touch with retailers, wholesalers, product finishers, and suppliers. The company lists over 350,000 sources in its numerous guides. </p><div class="section"><p>Another helpful source is Hoover&#8217;s Online at hoovers.com and </p></div><p>(512) 374-4501. This site offers basic information on 12 million companies worldwide including in-depth info on more than 40,000 companies. Their free service provides addresses and other basics. More detailed information is for sale at several levels and prices. Just remember that you must know the names of the retail companies you wish to study when using this service, whereas the other guides mentioned herein will provide information you may not find on your own. </p><p><i>200 </i><i>201 </i></p><div class="section"><p><i>MARKETING YOUR PRODUCT ON THE WEB </i></p><p>As you know from our chapter on creating your own Web site, you need to seek other Web sites to help promote your products. They will vary by industry, but these two are worth checking out. </p><p>Whereoware.com is a B2B (business-to-business) e-commerce Web site that acts like a mini-trade show, featuring a cross section of lines that can be viewed and purchased by retailers from anywhere in the world, 24/7. What makes this site special is that it partners with several top U.S. trade show producers and other valuable contacts. Whereoware.com offers cooperative programs, including a unique program with eBay, which will help you sell out-of-season and excess goods, and another offering low-cost health insurance for members. New resources to help manufactures and artisans are added to the Whereoware Web site regularly. Whereoware merchants are also entitled to discounts at several businesses that provide services to the industry. Best of all, retailers can come to this site and start shopping featured lines right away. </p><p>According to Mike Dean, the president of Western Exhibitors/ Universal Shows in San Francisco, buyers like the ability to connect with their resources on the Web during the off-season (when shows are not being produced). &#8220;The Internet has become an important tool for (gift) retailers faster than I originally thought it would,&#8221; said Dean. &#8220;Nearly 20% of retailers who shop our shows now order merchandise on the Web frequently, while another 39% order occasionally.&#8221; </p><p>This is good news for all manufacturers who want to maximize their market presence. Whereoware.com is especially important to independent retailers and buyers in nonmetropolitan areas and retailers who don&#8217;t see their sales reps on a regular basis during the off-season. </p><p>Another excellent source for connecting with retailers is limited to quality craft producers. Guild.com is a beautiful Web site with the goal of connecting artists to their most appropriate markets. Established in 1985, Guild has helped artisans in many other ways, such as serving as an educational center and cheerleader for the high-end crafts market. Currently there are over a thousand artisans in Guild&#8217;s various programs. Even if your business isn&#8217;t crafts, it&#8217;s fun to visit this site to shop at retail or simply admire the talent. </p></div><p><i>TARGETING SPECIFIC CUSTOMER BASES </i></p><p>If you want to market your product through the U.S. mail (catalogs or brochures), by phone, or on the Internet, you&#8217;ll be doing something called <i>direct marketing. </i>One of the most helpful sources you&#8217;ll find to understand the intricacies of this complex field is the Direct Marketing Association at (212) 768-7277 and the-dma.org. With all the new privacy regulations, it&#8217;s important to understand the specifics of what constitutes a legal method of contacting potential customers. If you contact people on the FCC&#8217;s Do Not Call list or on the soon-to-come antispam list, you could be assessed hefty fines. While direct marketing is very lucrative, don&#8217;t chance handling your database improperly! The Direct Marketing Association can educate you and your staff on privacy issues and assist in many other ways. </p><p>Another resource is <i>DMNews </i>(dmnews.com), an online newspaper for direct marketers. This site has lists and databases for sale and can connect you to the <i>DM Yellow Pages, </i>one of the industry&#8217;s B2B guides. </p><p>An excellent source for databases and labels is USA Data, which offers both B2B and consumer data lists and mailing labels. If you plan to promote your products directly to consumers instead of stores, USA Data&#8217;s demographic listings can really zero in on target markets. They include consumers lists based on lifestyle, hobbies, marital status, gender, age, ethnicity, religion, estimated income, renters vs. home owners, recreational vehicle owners, residences with swimming pools, and other criteria. The company offers free estimates for your specific needs. Contact them at (800) 599-5030 or at usadata.com. </p><p>Additionally, many professional organizations, trade shows, and trade magazines offer lists of potential customers within their main category for sale. </p><p>Ask all resources how often their lists are updated. While no list is perfect, you&#8217;ll want to purchase only audited lists&#8212;not lists that are simply compiled. This way, you&#8217;ll avoid wasting time and money courting people or companies that have moved or changed their e-mail address or phone number. </p><p>Another helpful resource is the Electronic Retailing Association, whose goal is to help manufacturers maximize their selling efforts on television, online, and on the radio. Whether you want to sell via an infomercial or straight advertising, this is a group worth checking into. Their Web site is retailing.org or call (800) 787-6462. </p><p><i>202 </i><i>203 </i></p><div class="section"><p><i>THE COUPON INCENTIVE </i></p><p>You may also want to entice customers through the popular arena called &#8220;coupon clipping.&#8221; Each year, millions of coupons are offered to attract new and repeat business. Sometimes a dollar-off coupon makes all the difference when choosing between two similar brands&#8212;especially for consumers who regularly shop at the many supermarkets offering double or triple coupon values. </p><p>In recent years the clipless coupon has emerged as an important factor in the coupon business. You&#8217;ve probably seen them in grocery and drug stores, where they magically appear in little machines next to the products they represent. Pull a coupon out of the little machine, and use it immediately. No scissors needed! </p><p>To learn more about both types of coupons, contact the Association of Coupon Professionals at couponpros.com. </p><p>Some manufacturers are also producing downloadable coupons and rebates on their own Web sites. If you believe your site is getting enough traffic, this alternative may work for you. In that case you may want to partner with a coupon/rebate site such as DealOne.com to bring your discount to the attention of more potential customers. </p><p><i>RETAIL MARKETING GROUPS TO THE RESCUE! </i></p><p>In chapter 8 you learned all the important reasons to connect with other manufacturers or artisans within your field through networking. Now we want to introduce you to some great organizations that can connect you to important <i>retail </i>bases. </p><p>If you think your product is perfect for major convenience store chains, for restaurant chains, or for every drug store in the country, there are retail marketing associations that can help you speed up your efforts. Some of these organizations have wholesaler divisions you can join. Other groups allow you to advertise in their in-house publications or show your wares at their trade shows or business conferences. Many of these groups also offer educational venues to help manufacturers learn how to work effectively and efficiently within massive markets. </p><p>If you want to court the mass merchants of the world, take a good look at the Retail Industry Leaders Association (RILA), formerly known as the International Mass Retail Association. The group changed its </p></div><p>name to reflect its broadening scope, which now includes chain stores. </p><p>RILA can be reached at (703) 841-2300 or at retail-leaders.org. </p><p>To work within the huge private label marketplace, look no further than the Private Label Manufacturers Association (PLMA). If your primary or secondary goal is to create products for merchants who want their own brand name on apparel and products that they don&#8217;t manufacturer themselves, this resource is excellent. According to the PLMA, &#8220;Store brands now account for one of every five items sold every day in </p><p>U.S. supermarkets, drug chains and mass merchandisers. They represent more than $50 billion of current business at retail and are achieving new levels of growth every year.&#8221; To find out more, check out their Web site (plma.com) or call them at (212) 972-3131. </p><p>Another interesting resource is the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America, a group that can connect your company with regional and national shoe chains and offers instructions on setting up private label programs. You can reach them at (202) 737-5660 and at fdra.org. </p><p>If you&#8217;re creating health and beauty products, you may want to consider the efforts of the American Health &amp; Beauty Aid Institute, which focuses primarily on African-American beauty and hair care products. Manufacturers who meet their standards can qualify for their seal of approval. They can be reached at (312) 644-6610 and at ahbai.org. </p><p>The General Merchandise Distributors Council works with health and beauty care stores, but also covers pharmacies, general merchandisers, value stores, and supermarkets with a variety of other products. International in scope, they can be reached at gmdc.org and at (719) 576-4260. </p><p>Several organizations cater to the massive drug store market across the United States. As their names indicate, both the Michigan-based Chain Drug Marketing Association, at (248) 449-9300 and chaindrug .com, and the Virginia-based National Association of Chain Drug Stores, at (703) 549-3001 and nacds.org, concentrate on chain drug store markets. Meanwhile, the National Association of Community Pharmacists at (703) 683-8200 and ncpanet.org specializes in independent, family-owned pharmacies. </p><p>If you long to cater to convenience stores, a helpful resource is the National Association of Convenience Stores, an organization with over 2,000 retail members who run more than 100,000 convenience store locations. They can be reached at (703) 684-3600 and at nacsonline.com. </p><p><i>204 </i><i>205 </i></p><div class="section"><p>The huge grocery/restaurant industry is supported by the Food-service Sales &amp; Marketing Association, which is an affiliate of Grocery Manufacturers of America. Contact them at (202) 295-3953 and at fsmaonline.com. A group that works with grocers and crosses over into the restaurant arena is the International Dairy-Deli-Bakery Association&#8212;a self-explanatory name if we ever heard one! They are at (608) 238-7908 and at iddba.org. Meanwhile, the National Council of Chain Restaurants, which is a division of the National Retail Federation, caters <i>(sorry!) </i>to nearly forty of this country&#8217;s largest restaurant companies. For more information, call (202) 626-8183 or check out their Web site at nccr.net. </p><p>Most car washes now have retail stores carrying everything from car supplies to snacks to greeting cards to gifts. Some also carry fresh flowers, gourmet foods, and an array of beverages. If you have an item appropriate for a car wash shop, check out the International Carwash Association online at carcarecentral.com or call (312) 321-5199. </p><p>There are also many excellent general retail marketing resources that may be of help to you. You&#8217;ll find a list of them in our Resource Guide at the back of this book. Look for chapter 20, Associations List. </p></div><p><i>CHAPTER 21<br/></i></p><div class="section"><p><i>THE MANY SALES <br/>OPPORTUNITIES BEYOND <br/>RETAIL STORES<br/></i></p></div><p>New companies always dream of landing that first <i>really </i>big retail account. But not all big new accounts are in the traditional storefront settings. Opportunities to work with nontraditional retailers and others who use products in their work can be found everywhere. You just need to know where to look and how to approach them. Here is our advice on several ways to expand your thinking about where you can sell your products. </p><p><i>STAY TUNED FOR MORE GREAT DEALS! </i></p><p>Television shopping networks today barely resemble the market at its inception almost twenty years ago. The $9 billion annual TV shopping market now represents almost every conceivable product category, from jewelry to clothing to home goods to high tech. </p><p>QVC (qvc.com) is the leader, with over $5.7 billion in sales on 137 million units shipped, according to their most recent figures. Founded in 1986, the company also has shopping channels in the United Kingdom, Japan, and Germany. QVC looks for an average of 250 new products to go on the air each week. Merchandise that appeals most to their buyers include developed brand names, products that offer a unique solution to an old problem, and items that compete with established products at lower prices. </p><p>The second largest player is the Home Shopping Network (hsn.com), which reported sales of $2.4 billion in 2004. Their viewership profile is much like the other networks: 75% female, age 40+ with an average income of $63,000 per year, so these stations no longer ap</p><div class="section"><p><i>207 </i></p><p>peal strictly to lower-income Americans. TV shopping networks&#8217; core customers are looking for better quality and design&#8212;and the shopping networks are delivering with more brand names and unique products. </p><p>Rounding out the top four players in this field are Shop NBC (shopnbc.com) with 2003 sales of $617 million and Shop at Home Network (shopathometv.com) with sales of only $239 million. However, the latter has developed alliances with several other important cable TV networks including HGTV, the Food Network, and Fine Living, which should help it develop quickly. This field is still growing at double-digit rates each year according to figures released by Shop NBC. And interestingly enough, a lot of their business comes from their Internet sites. </p><p>These companies are great outlets, but don&#8217;t approach them until you&#8217;ve got your production levels and distribution stream up and running. This is crucial because many of their TV programs are capable of selling thousands or even <i>tens of thousands </i>of units per hour. They&#8217;ll be partnering with you to make certain all these sales can be filled on a timely basis. </p><p>If you are pitching your product in person, be able to sum up the reason these networks need your product in a sentence or two. You&#8217;ll likely only have a couple of minutes to convince the buyer to bring in your product for evaluation. If they like your item, the evaluation will take several months. </p><p>Plan on double-boxing products, as some of these networks demand it. If your company produces products overseas, you must have a U.S. warehouse and an adequate supply of merchandise in the country to even be considered. (They will demand a warehouse confirmation up front.) </p><p>Almost everything else you&#8217;ll need to know is posted on their Web sites. Look for their vendor links, which usually offer downloadable versions of the paperwork that must accompany your product presentation. </p><p><i>INTERNET SHOPPING REGAINS ITS PROMINENCE </i></p><p>A few people thought the Internet shopping bubble had burst during spring 2000. Okay, a few hundred million people; but not us! We knew e-shopping would eventually take hold and win over a lot of satisfied customers&#8212;and that&#8217;s exactly what has happened. To understand the vast potential for marketing your product on the Internet, look no fur</p></div><div class="section"><p>ther than the fourth-quarter holiday figures for the past few years. </p></div><div class="section"><p>According to the 2003 <i>E-spending Report </i>by Goldman Sachs/Harris </p></div><p>Interactive/Nielsen NetRatings, holiday shoppers spent $18.5 billion for gifts online in 2003, representing a 35% increase over the previous holiday season. Apparel sales topped out at $3.8 billion (representing a 40% increase), while toys and video games brought in a remarkable $2.2 billion (33% increase) in Internet sales. Computer, video, and DVD software and hardware rounded out the biggest categories. Shoppers polled spent about 19.7% of their holiday budgets online. Best of all, the report found that only 3.6% of online shoppers were unhappy with their purchases. </p><p>An earlier holiday shopping report highlighted by the International Council of Shopping Centers found that online bookstores collectively logged 28 million visits during the month of December 2000. Sears had its first million-dollar Internet sales day during a recent holiday season, and Mediamark Research indicates that 64 million American adults use the Internet each month. No doubt, a lot of them are regularly shopping in what has become a major resource for all categories of products. </p><div class="section"><p>To find out more about this field, see chapters 3 and 12. </p></div><p><i>CATALOG SALES LOOK TO THE FUTURE </i></p><p>Every business category goes through ups and downs, and catalog companies are still a multibillion dollar market with millions of these sales tools being sent through the U.S. Postal Service daily. However, postal rates have gone up and the cost of producing catalogs has skyrocketed, while the customer base has softened. And then there&#8217;s the biggest factor in declining catalog sales: the Internet. </p><p>In the past retailers often did very well with storefront operations or a stand-alone catalog business or both. Now those same companies have been &#8220;forced&#8221; to create major Web sites, too. This has diluted the catalog business, at a time when the catalog and Internet divisions of companies are very expensive to operate. While Internet sales are thriving, the low-tech catalog business is down across the United States. But don&#8217;t look for that to last; catalog producers will likely reinvent themselves and come out ahead of the game. </p><p>In the meantime, there are some excellent catalog companies out there that you should definitely consider approaching. See the indus</p><p><i>208 </i><i>209 </i></p><div class="section"><p>try&#8217;s top magazine, <i>Catalog Age, </i>or visit catalogagemag.com and click on their Catalog 100 list. For additional information, contact the Direct Marketing Association at dma.org. </p><p><i>MUSEUM STORES MEAN BIG BUSINESS! </i></p><p>The opportunities to work with museum stores have increased in recent years, especially for certain product categories, including children&#8217;s products and high-quality, limited-edition crafts. </p><p>For many years museum stores were not allowed to stray far from what their collections and special shows represented. If a museum was about Impressionist art, most of what you saw in that museum&#8217;s store mimicked the collection. Museum stores needed to follow procedure if they wanted to keep their 501c status, the nonprofit rating the U.S. government closely controls. But in recent years, a new ruling called a UIT, or unrelated income tax, has allowed museums to purchase products unrelated to their collections and simply pay tax on them, making these stores popular shopping destinations for U.S. consumers. Some museums stores are doing even more to increase their market presence. Many are setting up seasonal kiosks in shopping malls to promote the museum and sell core products. Others have formed alliances with department stores to do the same. </p><p>If you have a product you think is right for art, science, children&#8217;s, or the many other types of museum stores around the country, consider joining the Museum Store Association. This organization, which has member stores here and around the globe, holds an annual Museums Retail Conference &amp; Expo and offers a quarterly magazine, <i>Museum Store, </i>in which you can advertise. You&#8217;ll find them at museum district.com and at (303) 504-9223. </p><p>Additionally, some major gift shows have wholesale divisions (such as George Little Management&#8217;s The Museum Source) that cater to museums stores and other stores that want to carry some of the same high-caliber products. Gift industry trade publications also cover the museum store field and products that appeal to them. </p><p>While the annual sales figures in this field are unavailable, museum stores sell a lot of products and benefit their institutions at the same time. If your products are right for museums, you&#8217;ll find no better showcase for them. </p></div><p><i>GALLERIES TAKE PRIDE IN THE LITTLE THINGS </i></p><p>Many art galleries and other purveyors of fine and functional art have increased their product categories in recent years, carrying greeting cards, fashion accessories, and other small items to be sold along with the art on the walls. By introducing these smaller price-point products, gallery owners are creating more reasons for the Average Joe and Jill to walk in and feel comfortable. If customers can peruse greeting cards and leather-bound personal journals in a high-end setting, they&#8217;ll feel right at home even if they can&#8217;t afford the $10,000 price tag on a nearby painting. And at the end of the day, all those little sales can add up to big dollars. </p><p>One of our favorite publications for watching this fascinating field is <i>American Craft, </i>which is published by the distinguished American Craft Council. They also produce quality craft shows around the country. The ACC can be reached at craftcouncil.org and at (212) 274-0630 for general inquiries and show information. </p><p>Product producers in this category also make excellent contacts at many of the gift shows around the country. Several shows have juried American craft divisions where you can be assured your product will be featured among other quality lines. Some shows now also feature quality international craft divisions. </p><p><i>ZOOS . . . PLUS AMUSEMENT, THEME,<br/>NATIONAL, AND STATE PARKS<br/></i></p><p>In recent years stores in these settings have grown from purveyors of postcards and novelties into full-fledged gift shops. You can still buy a keepsake T-shirt or snow globe, but you&#8217;ll also find signed, limited-edition crafts that carry the overall theme of these venues. Attendees can stop into their restaurants or snack shops, too, so we suggest food producers look into them as well. The category is too broad to figure the exact sales, but we know they&#8217;re huge. </p><p><i>PRODUCT PRODUCERS CAN CASH IN<br/>AT CASINOS, WINERIES, AND SPAS<br/></i></p><p>If you&#8217;ve ever traveled through Northern California&#8217;s famed wine country, you&#8217;ve possibly walked through some of the wonderful stores </p><p><i>210 </i><i>211 </i></p><div class="section"><p>in its wineries. Most carry wines and grape-themed products that cover a multitude of categories, from T-shirts to oven mitts to gift wrap to stemware. Many also carry quality crafts by local and national artisans. </p><p>Casinos are raking in the dough&#8212;and the big winners are looking for places to spend their money. Putting stores in casinos makes sense. &#8220;Many casinos in both Nevada and Atlantic City, as well as Indian reservation gaming houses, are becoming full-fledged resorts that have wonderful handmade merchandise or product indicative of the region&#8212;they&#8217;re great opportunities,&#8221; notes Stacey Heiss of Western Exhibitors/Universal Shows. </p><p>She also clued us in to the growing spa market, noting that some spas are in remote areas, so it makes sense for them to have gift and spa-product shops. That way, guests can bring home cotton robes, slippers, personal care products, and other items. </p><p><i>THE INCENTIVE BUSINESS GROWS UP </i></p><p>Incentive gifts are given for a myriad of reasons: to thank customers for their loyalty, to help a company motivate or reward its employees, as a purchase incentive, to develop and communicate a brand, to generate trade show and convention traffic, or to recognize an important business anniversary. Depending on the need, incentives can be as simple as a refrigerator magnet or as expensive and attractive as a gold watch or a crystal bowl. They&#8217;re often marked with a message or a company logo to serve as a constant reminder of their source. However, as this field develops and becomes more sophisticated, the means of conveying these messages and logos is becoming more subtle. </p><p>Recent figures estimate that the broad incentive business in the United States is worth $16 billion annually and growing at an average rate of 8% each year. So if your company can customize, there may be opportunities to do additional business in this arena. </p><p>To find out more, there are several resources, including the Incentive Marketing Association, at incentivemarketing.org and (630) 3697780, and the Promotion Marketing Association at pmalink.org, and </p><p>(212) 420-1100. Both organizations offer links to other industry resources, publications, trade shows, and conferences. </p></div><p><i>THE CORPORATE GIFT MARKET EXPANDS </i></p><p>A breakout division of the overall incentive gift market is the category called corporate gifts. These are special items given to customers or select groups, singly or in a gift box or a basket. Possibly the most notable among these are the famous gift baskets given to Oscar<sup>&#174; </sup>presenters at the Academy Awards<sup>&#174;</sup>. Those baskets have thousands of dollars worth of products, usually including food, champagne, clothing, technical gadgets, fine writing instruments, lotions and potions, and gift certificates. Yes, corporate gifts are also about creating goodwill but on a much more sophisticated level than incentives. </p><p>Originally, department stores &#8220;owned&#8221; this business and concentrated on monogramming. But in recent years the corporate gift business has shifted, and corporate customers have also expanded their search for more unique and creative gifts. Nowadays, corporate gifts may include fun toys for around the office, luxurious initialed bathrobes, colorful tool boxes, hand-rolled truffles, and aromatherapy products. In fact, according to our own JoAnne Stone-Geier, who was a pioneer in this field, many corporate gifts once considered taboo are now fair game. &#8220;Younger generations don&#8217;t collect silver bowls to showcase in their offices. They want practical items for their home, office, or family use,&#8221; she noted. </p><p>Everyone seems to want part of this lucrative field&#8217;s action. Jump on any number of Web sites from redenvelope.com to Williams-Sonoma to big box retailers, and they all seem to have corporate gift links. Now many independent specialty retailers are also courting this $2.5 billion market. </p><p>As you approach retailers, be sure to point out if your product has potential as a corporate gift. </p><p>Use contacts in the incentive field to find out more. Additionally, a publication called <i>Potentials </i>(potentials.com) is at the forefront of this market, and most gift industry trade magazines will also keep you up-to-date on the corporate gift field. </p><p><i>RED, WHITE, AND BLUE . . . AND GREEN! </i></p><p>The U.S. government and the U.S. military are huge, and so is your selling power to them if you have the right items. Forget trying to sell them $50 ash trays and $300 toilet seats&#8212;that type of gouging was put to rest long ago. But now you can either sell them a product they can </p><p><i>212 </i><i>213 </i></p><div class="section"><p>use or one that can be retailed in one of the many military shops around the world. Once called canteens, these stores have grown into super shopping centers. On military bases here and abroad, soldiers and their families are looking for the basics. But they&#8217;re also looking for gifts, toys, stationery, educational items, and other amenities of home. </p><p>The U.S. General Services Administration (gsa.gov) specializes in helping companies navigate through the red tape. They even offer local workshops for potential vendors. Another helpful government site is firstgov.gov. Both are excellent starting points for anyone interested in entering this multibillion dollar arena. </p><p><i>HOME SALES ARE ON THE RISE! </i></p><p>Some products sell best when they can be demonstrated. To help, a type of shopping that was very popular years ago is making a comeback: direct selling. Think Tupperware&#8212;then put a 21st-century spin on it. Products being demonstrated nightly in homes around the country include cookware, jewelry and fashion accessories, educational products, golf and sports items . . . and even adult sex toys. </p><p>Various reports indicate that this field has been rejuvenated by a desire for more opportunities to interact with family and friends in our fast-paced world. Customers can throw a little party and get some shopping done at the same time. </p><p>There are several advantages to this type of business. Since all sales are paid for in advance, product producers in this field need less up-front cash, have fewer cash flow problems, and can stock less inventory. However, motivating and keeping salespeople in this low-paying field is a factor to consider. </p><p>According to the Direct Selling Association (DSA), recent industry sales added up to an impressive $29.5 billion per year. If you believe your product might be right for direct selling, you can contact the DSA at dsa.org or at (202) 347-8866. </p></div><p><i>DUMPING GROUNDS: WHERE TO GET RID OF OLD OR UNWANTED MERCHANDISE </i></p><p>There&#8217;s nothing worse than watching a manufacturer sit on product that isn&#8217;t moving. Sitting on product ties up valuable funds and space that can be used to develop new products or increase inventory levels on best sellers. If you have something that needs to go, take a look at the many overstock and closeout merchandise options that exist. They sell a full range of products, from basics to designer goods. Two of the best resources we have found are SmartBargains.com, (617) 695-7300, and Overstock.com, (801) 947-3100. These two sites cover items from fashion accessories to bed linens to power tools. You can find additional resources by using the search words &#8220;overstock&#8221; and &#8220;closeout.&#8221; </p><p>If you have a limited amount of an item, consider either selling it on eBay (ebay.com) or giving it to a charity and claiming the donation at tax time. If the product is defective or unusable and can&#8217;t be sourced out or donated, write it off. At inventory time, you&#8217;ll be thankful you did. </p><p><i>214<br/></i></p><div class="section"><p><i>CHAPTER 22<br/></i></p><p><i>INDUSTRY LEADERS OFFER </i></p><p><i>YOU THEIR GUIDANCE AND </i></p><p><i>TALK ABOUT TRENDS </i></p><p>There are so many wonderful people in the various industries we cover in this book who will be more than willing to help you with solid advice along the road to business success.

Susan is the show director for their Las Vegas and New York Gourmet Housewares Shows: </p></div><p><i>Biggest challenge: </i>There is a myriad of competitive shows vying for </p><p>exhibit dollars. Manufacturers and artisans need to take a very hard look at the geography, timing, and type of attendance at the shows they are considering in order to make informed, intelligent choices. As show producers, it is our duty to provide the marketing and statistical information to these companies to assist them in their decision-making. <i>Biggest mistakes: </i>Many exhibitors forget to take advantage of the FREE preshow promotional opportunities, such as postcards that can be individualized to their prospective attendee audience. We encourage them to visit the show&#8217;s Web site for great &#8220;how to&#8221; information. We like to remind exhibitors that we can bring the right buyers to the show; it is up to them to get those buyers to their booth. And we have the tools for them to make this happen. </p><p><i>MARY JANE CRAIG </i>is the craft and gourmet food specialist at Western Exhibitors/Universal Shows, a company that produces a variety of trade and consumer shows in the United States and Canada: </p><p><i>What manufacturers do right/wrong: </i>When you introduce a product, you must already be working on the next one, because the average life expectancy for any product is about two years. <i>Biggest challenge: </i>When you&#8217;re copied, consider it a compliment. To patent an idea (in most nontech industries) is usually a study in futility; a person only needs to change the design slightly to get past lawsuits. I see people spend money and time in court pursuing these cases and losing. Move on and put your energy into something new instead! </p><p><i>MARY LIZ CURTIN, </i>of Mary Liz Curtin &amp; Company, a sales and marketing consultancy firm specializing in the gift, craft, and home markets, is an international speaker and writer on retailing and manufacturing: </p><p><i>Biggest mistake: </i>Planning is essential to success. A successful company does not have just one release but rather a series of timed introductions. It is easy to underestimate the immense appetite of the marketplace. <i>What manufacturers do right/wrong: </i>Manufacturers with basic, core products are doing well as their merchandise becomes essential to the retailer and the consumer. <i>Biggest challenge: </i>Coming </p><p><i>218 </i><i>219 </i></p><div class="section"><p>up with enough new product and staying profitable. Liquidating past-season or slow-selling inventory is another facet of the same problem. <i>Trends: </i>Value-oriented buying is always important. Customers are happy to pay for better product and higher quality but are sensitive to being overcharged . . . Home-based activities like cooking, crafting, and entertaining are on the rise . . . And finally, aging is a big trend. As the baby boomers age, look for more sales in everything from reading glasses to designer walkers. </p><p><i>MIKE DEAN </i>is president of Western Exhibitors/Universal Shows: </p><p><i>Trends: </i>The Internet has become an important tool for retailers far more quickly than I originally thought it would. Nearly 20% of retailers who shop our shows now order merchandise from the Web <i>frequently</i>&#8212;another 39% sometimes. This is huge&#8212;and those percentages are growing annually. The downside is that retailers are more apt to sit back and reorder than explore the marketplaces for new trends and unique merchandise. They&#8217;re less apt to experience the industry and network with peers. That&#8217;s tunnel vision! <i>Challenges: </i>In this (economic) environment it is difficult to estimate production. Manufacturers&#8217; products are so readily available these days that independent retailers are using their sources as stocking agents&#8212;ordering small amounts frequently. <i>How to analyze a trade show&#8217;s success: </i>Because of smaller, more frequent ordering, companies have to change the way they measure their return on investment (ROI) on trade shows. Exhibitors now have to count and track leads from each show to measure overall success because some buyers use shows to spot and pick up info on new products but then write orders for those products online&#8212; often a week or even a couple of months later. Therefore, leads and follow-up are essential to tracking the success of a show experience. </p><p><i>STEVE DEHAAN </i>is executive vice president of the National Home Furnishings Association in High Point, North Carolina, which also produces <i>Home Furnishings Retailer </i>magazine: </p><p><i>Trends: </i>Home office . . . home theater, and home entertainment . . . houses that are displayed (staged like movie sets) . . . laundry room as </p></div><div class="section"><p>an environment. Current designs are based on themes: European villa, </p></div><p>oceanside, island theme, and Southwest. <i>Challenges/solutions: </i>Be</p><p>cause of the global economy, price points are lower, so manufacturers need to find their own niche . . . To be successful, manufacturers need to see the retailer as the customer. They need to use their advertising dollars to support their retailers. They need to help brand the retailer. Otherwise they create a dual loyalty that clouds service to consumers. </p><p><i>LEATRICE EISEMAN, </i>color consultant, is director of the Pantone Color Institute, owner of the Eiseman Center for Color Information and Training, and one of the world&#8217;s leading color forecasters. She suggested we use this quote from her book, <i>Pantone Guide to Communicating With Color </i>(Grafix Press): </p><p><i>Product development: </i>There is no better way to gauge the effectiveness of color than in the marketplace where it is a vital key in communicating a positive, enticing and irresistible image to a product . . . Often called the &#8220;silent salesperson,&#8221; color must immediately attract the consumer&#8217;s eye, convey the message of what the product is all about, create a brand identity, and most importantly, help make the sale. </p><p><i>DEBRA GOLD, </i>president of Gold &amp; Company, is a consultant and strategic marketing/public relations specialist for several related industries, including the gift, home decor, and stationery fields: </p><p><i>Overview: </i>World style has now gone &#8220;mainstream.&#8221; What used to be &#8220;exotic&#8221; is now commonplace as decorating styles have become much more eclectic. High design has now become democratized, with popular looks and trends interpreted for every market segment and price point. And because of widespread &#8220;copycatting,&#8221; many more products are &#8220;look-alikes&#8221; for whatever trend is considered to be hot. Consequently, a product line must be really innovative, distinctive, trend-setting, highly lucrative, or just spectacular to stand out from the competition and capture the retailer&#8217;s attention. <i>What manufacturers are doing right: </i>To stay fresh and innovative, product designers can receive inspiration by looking outside of their own specific industry for ideas. &#8220;Cross-pollinating,&#8221; for example, fashion&#8217;s growing influence on home decor, or stationery designers licensing into the fashion or home </p><p><i>220 </i><i>221 </i></p><div class="section"><p>accessories market had become much more common. <i>Trends: </i>Home office, decorative yet functional storage, and outdoor/garden as a lifestyle. We used to want to bring the garden and garden themes indoors. Now we want our gardens to have the amenities and reflect the style and design of our homes. Opulent outdoor kitchens and entertainment areas have actually become status symbols&#8212;one expensive outdoor kitchen/barbeque can trigger the sale of many more, as neighbors try to keep up with the Joneses! </p><p><i>QUINN HALFORD</i>, editor-in-chief of <i>Gifts &amp; Decorative Accessories </i>magazine, gave us his thoughts on the home decor and overall gift markets: </p><p><i>Growth areas: </i>High perceived-value items that are functional and decorative at the same time . . . Clutter is out; simplicity is in. Consumers are looking for the best design, the best craftsmanship, and functionality. <i>Trends: </i>More retailers are buying fashion accessories as a new category . . . Home textiles give consumers a chance to change (their look) frequently. <i>Advice for new manufacturers: </i>Make sure that you have the budget to follow through with an important marketing effort . . . from trade show to PR. No matter how wonderful a product is, people won&#8217;t find it without the right efforts. Make sure your effort is consistent and broad-based. <i>Trade shows: </i>If you are bringing a unique, exacting, and distinguished product to market, you need to exhibit at a national show. This is a diverse country: what sells in San Francisco, for example, may not be right for another area. You need to give the trade shows time; doing one show doesn&#8217;t give you a whole picture of the sales process. Buyers need to see you return&#8212;in the same booth space, if possible. This is a wonderful industry which plays fair and wants new products. </p><p><i>STACEY HEISS </i>is marketing director for Western Exhibitors/Universal Shows. Her additional comments appear in chapter 21: </p><p><i>Biggest mistakes: </i>Not realizing that it takes money to make money&#8212; it&#8217;s about marketing, and yes, it can be expensive to market a product. But in order to be successful, budgets need to be created to allow for advertising, list purchase, trade shows, etc. . . . Not taking advantage of </p></div><div class="section"><p>many trade shows&#8212;limiting exposure to just one or two trade shows </p></div><p>will not create the appropriate impact for a product. Once the market </p><p>research is complete, the product should flood the marketplace in all regions. Manufacturers that do not have the staffing or funding should definitely look into representation from reputable companies. <i>What manufacturers are doing right: </i>Taking risks! That&#8217;s important to our industry: trying new things, colors, textures, etc. </p><p><i>MICHAEL KEIGHLEY </i>is editorial director at <i>The Gourmet Retailer, </i>one of the industry&#8217;s leading publications covering the gourmet, kitchen, housewares, and small appliance industries: </p><p><i>Biggest challenges: </i>Know who your end users are and what distribution you will need to build that base. It&#8217;s very costly to build a brand! . . . Manufacturers coming into this industry need to look very closely at consumer trends. In the kitchen consumers are looking for upscale, high-quality, and well-built products but also for low-end disposable goods. The middle market is lagging! <i>Trends: </i>At the moment, in our industry it&#8217;s anything that helps the consumer save time. For food producers, at this moment it&#8217;s all about ingredients or reduced ingredients, such as the carb craze. </p><p><i>KATHY KRASSNER </i>is editor-in-chief of <i>Greetings etc</i>.<i>, </i>a bimonthly trade magazine covering the greeting card, stationery, and party goods markets: </p><p><i>Trends: </i>We&#8217;re seeing more merchandise for children, tweens, and teens&#8212;our future customers. From greeting cards for kids to camp stationery sets to fun diaries and address books, the juvenile market is coming on strong in the stationery category. Surprisingly, e-mail and e-greetings have not had the negative impact on the greeting card industry that was feared. Instead, electronic correspondence has served to strengthen relationships, leading people to purchase printed cards for birthdays and other special occasions. <i>Challenges: </i>Discounting is certainly having some effect on the greeting card market. <i>Biggest mistakes: </i>Some people think they can bring a line of greeting cards to market with just a few designs printed on their home computer. Poor designs, poor quality of printing, too few designs, and a poorly devised </p><p><i>222 </i><i>223 </i></p><div class="section"><p>marketing plan will lead to failure in the (competitive) stationery industry. </p><p><i>RITA MALEK </i>is manager for EX&#183;TRACTS, a show featuring personal care and wellness products and trend items, produced by George Little Management: </p><p><i>Biggest challenges: </i>Competition is one of the biggest challenges, as the personal care, cosmetic, fragrance, and wellness industries are so multifaceted. A tremendous amount of advertising and marketing dollars are needed to stand out from the competition, and typically only the larger, well-established manufacturer can afford this type of investment. The industry also is constantly changing. In recent years the downturn in the economy has been an important factor, impacting consumer spending on luxury items, including fragrances. <i>Trends: </i>Products that allow customers to recreate the spa experience at home; natural products; home fitness accessories and apparel, including yoga mats, Pilates equipment, fitness videos, and yoga clothing are growing product categories; and sensory therapy products, such as fountains, wind chimes, acoustic relation machines, heating pads, eye masks, and neck pillows are also growing product categories. <i>What manufacturers are doing wrong: </i>Many small manufacturers are the most innovative and creative and certainly understand the manufacturing end of the business but do not understand how to market themselves. They are not aware of the many ways they can grow their business (such as getting to know the press, promoting their presence at trade shows by sending out mailings, following up on leads&#8212;more than 80% of leads gained at shows are never followed up!) </p><p><i>REED J. MCMILLAN </i>is director of marketing and communications for the American Craft Council in New York. The ACC also produces <i>American Craft </i>magazine, plus several wholesale and retail shows that feature high-quality, one-of-a-kind, and limited-edition pieces: </p><p><i>Market mind-set: </i>Crafting is an outdated word, reminiscent of the 1960s. Consumers are smarter about styles now. They&#8217;re looking for something that adds to the quality of life. <i>Challenges for artisans: </i></p></div><p>Chain stores have discovered that they can recreate the look of hand</p><p>made. Artisans shouldn&#8217;t be offended that the gift market is interested in their work . . . Think like designers, not artists, and learn the business language of art as well. This isn&#8217;t a hobby! Successful artisans can license their work (with retailers vs. galleries). Use the licensing money to create a different body of work, with different materials, different ideas, and sometimes even a different name. <i>Trends: </i>Home furnishings and fashion&#8212;especially jewelry. <i>What successful artisans do well: </i>Artisans need to be able to touch the heart of the consumer through an honest story: the story behind the piece or the story of the artist himself. Let the consumer know that they&#8217;re buying a piece of the artist when they buy his art. <i>Fixing common errors: </i>When artisans come into the marketplace, they often don&#8217;t do their research. Learn the psychology of marketing&#8212; take a business and accounting class. Find a mentor. </p><p><i>TERENCE MORRIS </i>is senior vice president/leasing for Americasmart-Atlanta, the Southeast&#8217;s gift, apparel, and home furnishings permanent showroom complex that is also the home to the Atlanta International Gift &amp; Home Furnishings Market and numerous apparel shows: </p><p><i>Biggest growth areas: </i>Over the past five years or more there has been an enormous growth in the home accents, accessories, and furnishings market. It has actually changed the direction of our industry. <i>Biggest challenge: </i>There is far more competition then ever before: knockoffs, buyouts, closing of businesses. The only way to stay ahead of the game is to continue being aggressive with new product introductions and more importantly, customer service. Taking good care of customers has fallen low on the radar screen. This has to once again become the priority of running businesses. </p><p><i>PERRY REYNOLDS </i>is vice president of marketing and trade development for the International Housewares Association, a well-known trade organization, which also produces the International Home and Housewares Show: </p><p><i>Biggest challenge: </i>Our industry&#8217;s manufacturers tell us that the driving force of change today is consolidation among retailers. Surviving </p><p><i>224 </i><i>225 </i></p><div class="section"><p>this consolidation demands exceptionally creative responses such as evaluating and entering new markets in which a company may leverage its current skill set and sell to nontraditional customers or sell current customers a wider range of products. Manufacturers must challenge traditional business models and look at their organization&#8217;s capabilities in a new light. <i>Trends: </i>One is a move to professional-quality products. This seems to be influenced by the rising recognition among the now well-off baby boomers that the products that they use in their homes should reflect their life situation and not be simply disposable tools. They are willing and able to spend more to buy a professional-quality, professionally designed product. <i>Biggest mistakes: </i>The most common complaint we hear from retailers concerns a lack of creativity among manufacturers. Retailers, large and small, are challenged not just to grow their business but to effectively differentiate their stores from their competitors. Increasingly, these retailers are focusing on innovation as a differentiation strategy. </p><p><i>LORI ROBINSON </i>is group show manager for George Little Management, in charge of the National Stationery Show, which takes place each May in New York. Her show covers the greeting card, stationery, gifts, home office, and party goods industries: </p><p><i>Trends: </i>With many products, it&#8217;s the color that stands out. Colors that are reminiscent of other decades are prevalent. Retro-inspired designs are still strong . . . Specialized cards are a growing category&#8212;the &#8220;thinking of you&#8221; card is no longer enough. Cards that spell out a specific, targeted message, whether it&#8217;s an adoption card, a card that captures the essence of a multicultural experience, or a card that tells your ex-boyfriend he&#8217;s a dud . . . The pet theme continues from cards to beds to fanciful collars and leashes. <i>What manufacturers are doing right: </i>Many new manufacturers do everything they can to get the most out of their trade show participation. In the aisles you noticed the eye-catching, clever, colorful, and economical booth displays. You do not need to spend a fortune to create an incredible display . . . More exhibitors understand the importance of pre- and postshow promotion to increase their chances of doing business with retailers. There are many options for publicizing your participation in a trade show and making your company stand out: a press kit, sending postcards to prospects or </p></div><p>previous attendees, or participating in a new product competition. </p><p>More and more manufacturers are taking advantage of these opportunities and seeing positive results. </p><p><i>PHIL ROBINSON </i>is senior vice president and group manager for George Little Management, in charge of the International Contemporary Furniture Fair (ICFF): </p><p><i>Biggest challenges: </i>The biggest challenges facing manufacturers in the furniture industry are the cost of production (relative to Far Eastern competitors) and the decline of independent retailers. <i>Trends: </i>The innovative use of new materials has been an emerging trend at the ICFF. <i>What manufacturers are doing wrong: </i>Missteps for manufacturers include failure to meet delivery deadlines for orders received and failure to follow up on sales leads generated at trade shows. <i>What manufacturers are doing right: </i>Marketing more aggressively and experimenting with design are two key factors for manufacturers. </p><p><i>MIKE RUSSO </i>is president of Industry Advisors, Inc., a company specializing in business education, planning, and assisting all arenas of the gift industry. He also serves as president of the Gift Association of America: </p><p><i>Trends: </i>There is a growing trend toward learning more about the industry and basic business. I have seen an increase in seminar attendance as well as direct contact from both buyers and manufacturers who are seeking all types of information. This can only result in long-term success. <i>Challenges: </i>Buyers not purchasing the usual &#8220;production run&#8221; quantities. They want to test merchandise before making a major commitment. Manufacturers are looking for large orders, and this is forcing them to focus on large chains and mass merchants, thus ignoring the small to mid-size retailer. The savvy manufacturer realizes that it is equally important to win smaller victories as they seek to maintain and build their business. <i>Mistakes: </i>First, not having a business plan . . . The second is having a well-documented business plan and leaving it on the shelf to collect dust. Employees follow their leaders. If monitoring progress and goals are not important for manage</p><p><i>226 </i><i>227 </i></p><div class="section"><p>ment, the employees cannot be held responsible when the business fails! </p><p><i>JOHN SAXTAN, </i>editor-in-chief of <i>Giftware News </i>magazine, had the following to say about the fields he and his staff cover: </p><p><i>Growth areas: </i>The interest in handcrafted goods and in the handcrafted look is strong. Ethnic markets are growing, especially Hispanic . . . Most &#8220;gift&#8221; purchases are actually purchases for self. <i>Trends: </i>High perceived value. Both retailers and buyers are looking harder than ever for products that have a reasonable cost, but look much more expensive . . . Preplanned assortments, especially for the holidays (including Halloween). Retailers buy a complete assortment without having to pick individual products or how many of each. This way they are less likely to end up with remainders . . . Shorter-lived products. Generally speaking, new giftware products are introduced twice a year. Watch for more frequent introductions of products that may be around for only one cycle (six months or less). This is intended to get trendier products into gift stores before (the design) hits the mass markets. </p><p><i>MILLIE SZERMAN </i>is president of New Directions, a company that consults and creates public relations materials for product manufacturers in several industries. She is also the author of <i>A View From the Tub: An Inspiring and Practical Guide to Working From Home </i>(Stairwell Press), which offers excellent information for new entrepreneurs, as well as established ones, who are working in a home-based business: </p><p><i>Biggest mistake: </i>There is no NEW product! Everyone wants a winner, and there is a flood of copycat goods in the marketplace. Manufacturers are reluctant to take a chance, and, unfortunately, it&#8217;s taking its toll on the buying public. <i>What manufacturers are doing right: </i>They&#8217;re asking questions, anticipating retailer and consumer needs, and scaling their manufacturing to address those needs . . . specifically in costs. <i>Biggest challenge: </i>Retail pricing is a big issue, and manufacturers seem to be addressing this by producing product overseas, where labor is incredibly cheap! Unfortunately, sometimes product quality suffers because of this focus. <i>Trends: </i>There&#8217;s a return to the past . . . </p></div><div class="section"><p>what&#8217;s old is new again. My mother used to say that if you keep your </p></div><p>clothes for twenty-five years, they&#8217;ll be back in fashion. How true that </p><p>seems to be! </p><p><i>JOYCE WASHNIK </i>is the publisher of <i>Giftbeat, </i>a monthly newsletter than closely follows product trends in retail stores: </p><p><i>Trends: </i>The name of the game is perceived value: customers are searching for well-priced products that look like they&#8217;re worth twice as much as the sticker price says. Everyone wants a bargain, even those in higher-income brackets. <i>Biggest mistakes: </i>Not realizing the importance of channels of distribution. You can&#8217;t expect to sell specialty retailers the exact same product you sell to big discounters like Wal-Mart. If manufacturers are going to sell to independent specialty stores, then that&#8217;s where they need to focus. <i>What manufacturers are doing right: </i>As far as the Internet goes, those who use their sites to inform consumers, not sell to them, are successful. Retail locators on Web sites get a thumbs-up from buyers, who see this as a way of partnering with their vendors. </p><p><i>WOODY WINFREE </i>was the long-time editor of <i>Travelware </i>magazine who left to found a company that produces creative and educational works that encourage personal discovery and growth for women: </p><p><i>Biggest mistakes: </i>Over all my years in the industry, the biggest mistake that new manufacturers made was poorly preparing themselves for dealing with retailers. Most would get their products in order and come to market with a well-made and useful addition, but be unprepared and ill informed as to the expectations and limitations that buyers had for adding the new product to their inventory. In other words, the unseasoned manufacturer would invest necessarily in product development, plan their manufacturing and delivery details, then head for the industry trade show. But they would arrive without sufficient understanding of the retailers&#8217; buying seasons, <i>co-op dollar demands, </i>payment terms, etc. Right off the bat, the manufacturer is behind the eight ball playing catch-up and trying to learn these details as he goes . . . Often, too, some will enter with one &#8220;grand&#8221; product and not have the breadth to attract buyers&#8212;the old one-trick pony syndrome! </p><p><i>228 </i></p><div class="section"><p><i>CHAPTER 23 </i></p><p><i>AUTHORS</i><i>&#8217;</i><i> NOTE: </i></p><p>This chapter provides information for the following product producers: </p><ul><li>U.S. companies hoping to make their products abroad </li><li>U.S.-based importers of foreign goods </li><li>International companies seeking opportunities in the United States </li><li>U.S. exporters </li></ul></div><div class="section"><p><i>WHAT YOU DON&#8217;T KNOW CAN HURT YOU! </i></p><p>It used to be fairly easy to bring products into the American marketplace. Unfortunately, 9/11 changed all of that. The threat of international terrorism has created a sense of vigilance in the U.S. Customs Department that is unlikely to wane. It&#8217;s a new era for shipping merchandise into the United States, and both international companies and </p><p>U.S. product producers who are manufacturing abroad must heed the many changes that have come into play or they will get stuck&#8212;<i>literally</i>. </p><p>One need look no further than the list of shipments from other countries that currently are stuck in customs, having been turned away from entering the United States. </p><p>Most of these products didn&#8217;t meet the strict specifications regulated by the Food and Drug Administration, which oversees imported foods, beverages, cosmetics, personal care, drugs, and several other categories. Others are turned away for smaller, but important, infractions such as improper labeling, use of prohibited materials, or inferior quality. A few </p></div><p>of these products may eventually pass through customs, but most are </p><p>awaiting instructions on how each manufacturer wants to ship their goods back. </p><p>What&#8217;s so interesting about the &#8220;no entry&#8221; list is the fact that it&#8217;s fairly long and the countries with the most rejected lines are often well-established here. While this list changes constantly, a recent one indicated that eleven lines each were being stopped from the United Kingdom and France, twelve from Germany, and nine from Japan&#8212; some of our biggest trading partners. </p><p>We mention the &#8220;no entry&#8221; list for one important reason: to point out that many companies are still lax about the rules of import/export. Today you must play by all the rules. While this creates extra work for manufacturers and their agents, it gets easier if you take the time to develop a clear understanding of the process. </p><p>Like other countries, the United States has preferred trade partners for various product categories. For those countries, the rules are not relaxed as much as the process is streamlined&#8212;making it simpler to trade back-and-forth. If you&#8217;re lucky enough to be shipping products to the United States from one of our country&#8217;s main trade partners, you&#8217;ll likely have many of your own government&#8217;s sources in place to help you. For instance, the government of Canada enjoys an exceptional trade status with the United States due to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Subsequently, the Canadians have managed to develop all the necessary tools to help their manufacturers and artisans sell and deliver products to the U.S. market with ease. They recently developed a series of publications called <i>Roadmap to Exporting (</i>via exportsource.ca for Canadians only) that are exceptional. </p><p><i>RESOURCES FOR INTERNATIONAL COMPANIES </i></p><p>Check with your country&#8217;s embassy in Washington or, better yet, with the regional consulate where you plan to do business first (such as New York or California).

Since the United States is interested in helping international companies do business here, this service is free. </p><p><i>SPECIAL REGULATIONS FOR U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL COMPANIES </i></p><p>All companies that come under the jurisdiction of the Food and Drug Administration should access its Web site at fda.gov to review content and labeling rules and to read the Bioterrorism Act. </p><p>Through another government Web site (export.gov), you can access a link to the magazine <i>Export America</i>. This publication, which costs less than $100 for a year&#8217;s subscription, will help keep you up-to-date on U.S. trade policy. </p><p>Three nongovernmental associations may also be of assistance. They are the American Association of Exporters and Importers (aaei.org), the American Importers Association, a group that covers importing, exporting, and wholesaling (americanimporters.org), and the Association of Food Industries, which covers foods and beverages (afius.org). </p><p>Remember that all U.S. regulations are subject to change, so you or your agents will need to stay on top of all new developments. </p><p><i>SPECIAL INFORMATION FOR U.S. COMPANIES THAT PLAN TO PRODUCE PRODUCT ABROAD FOR THE AMERICAN MARKET </i></p><p>Though we&#8217;ve worked with countless international companies hoping to do business in the United States, only one of us has exported product. Therefore, we went to a leading expert in this field, Mike Russo. Russo is the president of Industry Advisors, Inc., a company that specializes in business education, planning, and assisting manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers, primarily in the broad category called the gift industry. </p></div><div class="section"><p>Russo has helped countless lines export their goods into the United </p></div><p>States. He also acts as a consultant for American manufacturers, helping </p><p>them establish connections in other countries. During his many years of developing product in Asia, Russo has experienced both the ups and downs of doing business abroad. </p><p>Russo started his conversation with us by pointing out that there are two types of U.S. businesses that typically produce goods abroad: established companies that plan on augmenting their current stateside business and new companies that may be planning on doing everything abroad. </p><p>He had words of caution for established companies&#8217; owners, who sometimes try international production for the wrong reasons. &#8220;Make sure that the current business is stable and that knowledgeable personnel are in place to oversee the day-to-day operations while a new team focuses on the outsourced portion of the business. Outsourcing abroad should be an expansion of the business&#8212;not a means to save it,&#8221; Russo noted. </p><p>Russo also had specific ideas about how to do this. &#8220;Develop a strategic plan for analyzing the weaknesses that currently exist in the company structure, the opportunities that manufacturing abroad offers, the threats to the current business that it may present, and the strengths that currently exist in the company,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Realize that this will shift your focus. Addressing these issues provides a blueprint that will keep management in control of both the current business and the new outsourced division of the company.&#8221; </p><p>After seeing so many brand-new companies struggle to get their businesses abroad up and going, Russo said, &#8220;It&#8217;s critical that they spend considerable time learning the ins and outs of the country they&#8217;ve targeted. This will include extended visits to the country.&#8221; </p><p>New manufacturers should get a firm handle on what&#8217;s happening in the U.S. marketplace prior to heading abroad to establish production, Russo suggests. &#8220;Trade show visits are an excellent opportunity to gather information about market trends, trade publications, special events, sales representatives, and a host of other important issues that will need to be addressed if the outsourced effort is to be successful,&#8221; Russo explained. </p><p>Once a manufacturer&#8212;new or established&#8212;has handled these details, he or she is ready to start looking for an overseas factory. Russo offered many important tips. </p><p>&#8220;The first thing that any designer should do before showing their portfolio is to have a confidentiality agreement in place to protect designs from being produced without permission,&#8221; he cautioned. &#8220;Designs may be shown to many people. Without proper protection in place, the </p><p><i>234 </i></p><div class="section"><p><i>235 </i></p><p><i>LAUNCH IT! TRADE ADVICE </i></p><p>With the rise of many small countries and break-offs from larger nations, expect to see more international business conducted through regional trade groups such as the Association of Southeast Asia Nations (ASEAN), the European Union (EU), our homegrown North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and others. If you plan to do business across borders, ask about regional groups, then check out their goals, restrictions, and other basic information online. They&#8217;re there to simplify the process of doing business, even though their restrictions can seem daunting. To help you maneuver through some of the paperwork, one excellent resource is the U.S.-ASEAN Business Council, based in Washington, </p><p>D.C. They can be reached at (202) 289-1911, or you can seek out their member-nation specialists at us-asean.org. If you will be outsourcing products from Europe, you can reach the EU&#8217;s Washington, D.C., office at (202) 862-9500 or check out their partnership information online at eurunion.org. </p><p>designer is at risk of having his or her creative ideas &#8216;knocked off&#8217; before they get their structure and production in place.&#8221; </p><p>Counterfeiting, especially for products made outside the United States, is a problem worth noting. According to a February 2005 report by Frederik Balfour for <i>Business Week, </i>counterfeiting has become as popular and profitable as trading illegal narcotics, with groups specializing mainly in luxury items, high-end and popular styles of clothing and footwear, medicine, memory chips, auto parts, motorcycles, cigarettes, and even popular brands of soaps and cleaners. The industry has become very sophisticated. &#8220;Counterfeiters are skilled at duplicating holograms, &#8216;smart&#8217; chips, and other security devices,&#8221; Balfour states. &#8220;They can also disguise their wares before they reach their final destination. Some ship unmarked counterfeit parts in several consignments to be assembled and labeled at their destination.&#8221; </p><p>The World Customs Organization (WCO), at wcoomd.org, reports that up to 7% of the world&#8217;s trade may be counterfeit merchandise. China, where the problem is huge, has finally agreed to crack down. According to Balfour&#8217;s report, other problem countries include the Philippines, Vietnam, Russia, Ukraine, Brazil, Pakistan, and Paraguay. The factories are often funded by organized crime groups or Middle Eastern groups that sometime use part of the money to finance terrorist groups. Unfortunately, since much of the business in fakes is now global </p></div><p>instead of local, many factories can be shut down in one country and be </p><p>unaffected elsewhere. The U.S. government is diligent in their search for counterfeit products. In 2004 their seizures increased by over 45% at our nation&#8217;s borders. </p><p>Meanwhile, Russo suggests that you visit several factories, even if you like the first one. &#8220;There are many levels of quality, and it&#8217;s important to see the merchandise that different factories produce. It&#8217;s important to establish the proper price and quality level necessary to create exciting, competitive products,&#8221; he explained. </p><p>Ask a lot of questions. &#8220;Product development involves the production of prototypes, final samples, inventory, packaging, labeling, and many other factors,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Questions such as lead time for samples, as well as production lead time for inventory, packaging, quality control, and communication channels must be understood,&#8221; Russo further noted. </p><p>Anyone new to this process may run the risk of costly or even disastrous miscommunications. &#8220;If the designer does not have command of the language, he must use an agent. I suggest interviewing many agents before making a final decision,&#8221; he remarked. </p><p>Once you are at a factory, determine if that factory can produce your product(s) exactly to your specifications. If there are even minor changes, discuss them at length. </p><p>Find out when the factory owner expects payment for your goods. Will it be partial payment up front and the rest upon completion? Are there other up-front fees, such as a onetime set-up charge? Will you be charged separately for samples, and if so, when? Are mold costs a separate fee, or are they included in your product quote? </p><p>Explain your anticipated production levels and delivery date, then ask: Does your factory have the capability to produce this level of merchandise? Ask also about outside factors that might influence production at other times of the year. For instance, in some countries businesses close down for a month or more during the hot summer months. Also ask about holidays that might delay your product&#8217;s production. </p><p>Next, discuss your packaging and labeling needs. If your product is fragile, this will be a special concern. For all color decisions, use your Pantone color chart (which is used internationally to determine colors). </p><p>How will your merchandise get from the factory to your importer? A freight forwarder must be selected, and a port of entry determined, as well as a warehouse. </p><p>Once you have a factory, send them everything they&#8217;ll need to produce your product correctly. &#8220;Create detailed drawings showing the </p><p><i>236 </i><i>237 </i></p><div class="section"><p>front, sides, back, top, and bottom of the item to be produced. Include measurements and Pantone colors, as well as any other specific information,&#8221; Russo detailed. &#8220;The same information will be needed for packaging, special labels, drop tags, manuals, and logo instructions.&#8221; Russo suggests creating a fact sheet for each product and component to be manufactured by that facility that can be used as a checklist. </p><p>It&#8217;s best to start with a consultant in this country before you even set foot in the country where you&#8217;re looking to manufacture. &#8220;Instead of taking your prototype or the product&#8217;s designer on a &#8216;fishing expedition&#8217; to find resources and agents, the consultant will be able to prepare focused itineraries and work as a liaison for your company,&#8221; Russo noted. </p><p>Russo&#8217;s closing advice is an excellent adage: &#8220;Always remember the five Ps of business: Proper Planning Prevents Poor Performance.&#8221; </p><p>One more piece of excellent advice came from a Southeast Asia&#8211; based product consultant (who&#8217;s name was unfortunately lost in a computer crash while we were working on this book): he noted that too many American manufacturers approach factory owners and their workers the wrong way. Americans always talk initially about building a long-term relationship, but they don&#8217;t realize that many of these small entrepreneurs and their employees are living hand to mouth. They don&#8217;t care about the business you promise down the road. They need to take care of their basic needs today. For many, it&#8217;s first come, first served&#8212;at least until you have a lengthy relationship and they see that they can trust you. </p><p><i>SPECIAL INFORMATION FOR U.S. COMPANIES THAT PLAN TO PRODUCE PRODUCT IN THE </i></p><p><i>U.S.</i><i> MARKET FOR SALES ABROAD </i></p><p>Some American manufacturers and artisans may be more interested in selling their merchandise abroad than in producing products there. </p><p>Luckily, there are many excellent sources to help you. The U.S. Department of Commerce has created a division called buyUSA, which we mentioned in the importer section of this chapter. This source helps bring U.S. product producers together with thousands of qualified international buyers, distributors, and agents who are looking for products in your category. It&#8217;s a great, free way to get started without having to leave the comfort of your office. </p></div><div class="section"><p>Additionally, U.S. embassies in the countries to which you plan to </p></div><p>travel will be very helpful. Ask for their trade divisions, and call several </p><p>weeks in advance to set up an appointment. </p><p>Two other great sources are trade shows, both in the United States and abroad. All major U.S. trade shows draw well-established international buyers who are looking for the latest U.S. trends and fads to bring back to their own countries. </p><p>To find out more about international trade shows, consult trade magazines in your industry, as well as gift industry trade magazines, which cover many product categories and write about many of the international shows (often called fairs). After reading about the various markets in these publications, consult the Web sites of the ones you&#8217;re most interested in attending (most are multilingual). </p><p>Never plan to attend an international or U.S. trade show without carrying the proper business credentials. No matter how far you&#8217;ve come, they may turn you away if you don&#8217;t have the proper identification! </p><p><i>GENERAL ADVICE FOR AMERICANS<br/>OUTSOURCING ABROAD AND IMPORTERS<br/></i></p><p>Our advice for exporters and importers includes having at least one member of your company learn the language of the country where you&#8217;ll be doing business. Even if you have an agent there, do not depend completely on someone else to guide you. After all, it&#8217;s your business! We suggest you use a language resource, such as Berlitz (berlitz .com will access this site in various languages, or go to berlitz.us for English), a leader in language emersion programs with both recorded and in-person training available. </p><p>Additionally, bone up on the country&#8217;s history, sites, cities, and people. Purchase a travel guide, such as those produced by Baedeker, which includes maps. </p><p>Finally, read one or more of the excellent customs guides written by Roger E. Axtell, who traveled the world for the Parker Pen Company. His books include <i>Do&#8217;s and Taboos Around the World </i>(a cultural guide) and <i>Do&#8217;s and Taboos of Using English Around the World</i>. A must read is <i>Gestures: The Do&#8217;s and Taboos of Body Language Around the World</i>. </p><p>More than ever, it&#8217;s important for all of us to present ourselves well in the international marketplace. Learn a little and it will go a long way in making your business trip more successful, fun, and relaxing. </p><p><i>238 </i></p><div class="section"><p><i>AUTHORS</i><i>&#8217;</i><i> NOTE: </i>Any group&#8217;s appearance in our Resource Guide does not indicate our endorsement.

Perfect for shopping, traveling, and gift giving, the Walk &#8217;N Roll is manufactured by two stylish Chicago women who found that schlepping all of their daily necessities was causing their maturing shoulders to cry out in protest. </p><p>The company was founded by Marina Rosenbaum and Joan Stanelli, longtime friends. Stanelli in particular was aware of the damage too much toting was placing on her shoulders and back. Self-employed, her business as a nationally regarded public speaker and magazine columnist requires constant travel and toting suitcases, a laptop, and other necessities. Stanelli&#8217;s chiropractor was constantly reminding her that her shoulders were rebelling from the workload she was placing on them. </p><p>Initially, Stanelli turned to various pull-carts as a solution. Unfortunately, every device she found either made her look and feel like she was pulling a shopping cart or immigrating to another country. She also found that the bulkiness of those carts was a hazard to walkers all around her. More than once, people tripped and fell over small carts she pulled behind her. She also worried about her valuables while pulling things behind her, where she couldn&#8217;t see them. Finally, when many of the trade shows she was attending starting banning pull-carts, Stanelli knew she needed to find something else&#8212;and quickly! </p><div class="section"><p>It was then, after a futile search, she and Rosenbaum started discussing the pos</p></div><p>sibility of manufacturing an attractive side-cart that would appeal to shoppers, </p><p>businesspeople, students, travelers&#8212;and possibly even to Santa. </p><p>The Walk &#8217;N Roll solved all Stanelli&#8217;s toting problems. In preliminary testing, it is already being praised by chiropractors and by people in the airline industry. (The lightweight, easy-to-fold Walk &#8217;N Roll fits easily into airplane overhead storage compartments.) It also turns 360 degrees, making it far less cumbersome than other tote equipment. It is approved for up to 50 pounds of weight. </p><div class="section"><p>So, who needs Rudolph, after all? Let him enjoy his retirement. Santa now has </p></div><p>a cool new helper at his beck and call. As for other busy shoppers this holiday sea</p><p>son, now they can shop, shop, shop, and <i>NOT </i>drop! </p><p><i>256 </i><i>257 </i></p><div class="section"><p><i>For additional information: </i></p><p>Media Contact: </p><p>_____________ - phone _____________ - fax _____________ - e-mail </p><p><i>Story ideas / angles: </i></p><ul><li>new product design articles / ergonomically correct </li><li>holiday gift ideas </li><li>businessperson&#8217;s best friend angle </li><li>medical angle / approved by chiropractors </li><li>Chicago angle (in Illinois) </li></ul></div><div class="section"/><p><i>EXAMPLE TWO: STANDARD APPOINTMENT / MANAGEMENT CHANGE RELEASE FOR TRADE PUBLICATIONS AND LOCAL NEWSPAPERS </i></p><p><i>For immediate release </i></p><div class="section"><p><i>Beverly Hills Apparel Appoints<br/>Lola Kramer Head Designer<br/></i></p></div><p><i>Beverly Hills, CA - 9/15/05: </i>Lola Kramer, who made such a big industry splash with her design called Waist Management for Uptown Accessories in New York, was appointed today to head the design efforts of Beverly Hills Apparel, a company specializing in contemporary fashions for the juniors market. Kramer replaces John Birmingham, who resigned last month to accept a position in Hong Kong. </p><p>Kramer, a graduate of the Rhode Island School of Design, joined Uptown immediately upon graduation and had been with the firm for fifteen years, rising quickly to overseeing all aspects of design and production of its women&#8217;s division. Kramer&#8217;s Waist Management line has posted sales in excess of $75 million over the past two years. </p><p>In her new position, Kramer will report to Janet Evanston, president. Evanston, in commenting on Kramer&#8217;s appointment, said, &#8220;We welcome Lola&#8217;s fresh approach to our business and, having reviewed some of her preliminary sketches, look forward to her first collection for the spring 2006 market, where she has already promised a new level of sophistication.&#8221; </p><div class="section"><p>Kramer&#8217;s new title will be vice president / apparel and production. </p></div><p><i>photo attached: Lola Kramer </i></p><p><i>For additional information, please contact: </i></p><p>_____________ - phone _____________ - fax _____________ - e-mail </p><p><i>258<br/></i></p><div class="section"><p><i>259 </i></p><p><i>CHAPTER 15: U.S.&#8217;S LARGEST INDEPENDENT TRADE SHOW PRODUCERS for multiple product categories in major cities </i></p><p><i>AUTHORS</i><i>&#8217;</i><i> NOTE: </i>There are many smaller companies that produce quality shows around the country.
